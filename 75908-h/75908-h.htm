<p class="ph2">Music and Bad Manners</p></div>


<p>Singers, musicians of all kinds, are notoriously
bad mannered. The storms of the
Titan, Beethoven, the petty malevolences of
Richard Wagner, the weak sulkiness of Chopin
(“Chopin in displeasure was appalling,” writes
George Sand, “and as with me he always controlled
himself it was as if he might die of suffocation”)
have all been recalled in their proper
places in biographies and in fiction; but no attempt
has been made heretofore, so far as I am aware, to
lump similar anecdotes together under the somewhat
castigating title I have chosen to head
this article. Nor is it alone the performer who
gives exhibitions of bad manners. (As a matter
of fact, once an artist reaches the platform he is
on his mettle, at his best. At home he—or she—may
be ruthless in his passionate display of
floods of “temperament.” I have seen a soprano
throw a pork roast on the floor at dinner, the day
before a performance of Wagner’s “consecrational
festival play,” with the shrill explanation,
“Pork before <i>Parsifal</i>!” On the street he may
shatter the clouds with his lightnings—as, indeed,
Beethoven is said to have done—but on the stage
he becomes, as a rule, a superhuman being, an interpreter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>a mere virtuoso. Of course, there are
exceptions.) Audiences, as well, may be relied
upon to behave badly on occasion. An auditor is
not necessarily at his best in the concert hall. He
may have had a bad dinner, or quarrelled with his
wife before arriving. At any rate he has paid
his money and it might be expected that he would
make some demonstration of disapproval when he
was displeased. The extraordinary thing is that
he does not do so oftener. On the whole it must
be admitted that audiences remain unduly calm at
concerts, that they are unreasonably polite, indeed,
to offensively inadequate or downright bad
interpretations. I have sat through performances,
for example, of the Russian Symphony Society
in New York when I wondered how my fellow-sufferers
could display such fortitude and
patience. When <i>Prince Igor</i> was first performed
at the Metropolitan Opera House the ballet,
danced in defiance of all laws of common sense or
beauty, almost compelled me to throw the first
stone. The parable saved me. Still one doesn’t
need to be without sin to sling pebbles in an opera
house. And it is a pleasure to remember that
there have been occasions when audiences did
speak up!</p>

<p>In those immeasurably sad pages in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>Henry Fothergill Chorley describes the last London
appearance of Giuditta Pasta, recalling Pauline
Viardot’s beautiful remark (she, like Rachel,
was hearing the great dramatic soprano for the
first time), “It is like the <i>Cenacolo</i> of Da Vinci at
Milan—a wreck of a picture, but the picture is
the greatest picture in the world!” this great
chronicler of the glories of the opera stage recalls
the attitude of the French actress: “There were
artists present, who had then, for the first time,
to derive some impression of a renowned artist—perhaps,
with the natural feeling that her reputation
had been exaggerated.—Among these was
Rachel—whose bitter ridicule of the entire sad
show made itself heard throughout the whole theatre,
and drew attention to the place where she sat—one
might even say, sarcastically enjoying the
scene.”</p>

<p>Chorley’s description of an incident in the
career of the dynamic Mme. Mara, a favourite
in Berlin from 1771 to 1780, makes far
pleasanter reading: “On leave of absence being
denied to her when she wished to recruit her
strength by a visit to the Bohemian <i>baden</i>, the
songstress took the resolution of neglecting her
professional duties, in the hope of being allowed
to depart as worthless. The Czarovitch, Paul the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>First of Russia, happened about that time to pay
a visit to Berlin; and she was announced to appear
in one of the grand parts. She pretended illness.
The King sent her word, in the morning of the
day, that she was to get well and sing her best.
She became, of course, worse—could not leave
her bed. Two hours before the opera began, a
carriage, escorted by eight soldiers, was at her
door, and the captain of the company forced his
way into her chamber, declaring that their orders
were to bring her to the theatre, dead or alive.
‘You cannot; you see I am in bed.’ ‘That is of
little consequence,’ said the obdurate machine;
‘we will take you, bed and all.’ There was nothing
for it but to get up and go to the theatre;
dress, and resolve to sing without the slightest
taste or skill. And this Mara did. She kept her
resolution for the whole of the first act, till a
thought suddenly seized her that she might be
punishing herself in giving the Grand-Duke of
Russia a bad opinion of her powers. A <i>bravura</i>
came; and she burst forth with all her brilliancy, in
particular distinguishing herself by a miraculous
shake, which she sustained, and swelled, and diminished,
with such wonderful art as to call down
more applause than ever.” This was the same
Mara who walked out of the orchestra at a performance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>of <i>The Messiah</i> at Oxford rather than
stand during the singing of the <i>Hallelujah Chorus</i>.</p>

<p>In that curious series of anecdotes which Berlioz
collected under the title, “Les Grotesques de
la Musique,” I discovered an account of a performance
of a <i>Miserere</i> of Mercadante at the
church of San Pietro in Naples, in the presence of
a cardinal and his suite. The cardinal several
times expressed his pleasure, and the congregation
at two points, the <i>Redde Mihi</i> and the <i>Benigne fac,
Domine</i>, broke in with applause and insisted upon
repetitions! Berlioz also describes a rehearsal of
Grétry’s <i>La Rosière de Salency</i> at the Odéon, when
that theatre was devoted to opera. The members
of the orchestra were overcome with a sense of
the ridiculous nature of the music they were performing
and made strange sounds the while they
played. The <i>chef d’orchestre</i> attempted to keep
his face straight, and Berlioz thought he was scandalized
by the scene. A little later, however, he
found himself laughing harder than anybody else.
The memory of this occasion gave him the inspiration
some time later of arranging a concert
of works of this order (in which, he assured himself,
the music of the masters abounded), without
forewarning the public of his purpose. He prepared
the programme, including therein this same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>overture of Grétry’s, then a celebrated English
air <i>Arm, Ye Brave</i>, a “sonata <i>diabolique</i>” for the
violin, the quartet from a French opera in which
this passage occurred:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“J’aime assez les Hollandaises,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Les Persanes, les Anglaises,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Mais je préfère des Françaises</div>
<div class="verse indent0">L’esprit, la grâce et la gaîté,”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>an instrumental march, the finale of the first act
of an opera, a fugue on <i>Kyrie Eleison</i> from a
Requiem Mass in which the music suggested anything
but the words, variations for the bassoon on
the melody of <i>Au Clair de la Lune</i>, and a symphony.
Unfortunately for the trial of the experiment
the rehearsal was never concluded. The
executants got no further than the third number
before they became positively hysterical. The
public performance was never given, but Berlioz
assures us that the average symphony concert audience
would have taken the programme seriously
and asked for more! It may be considered certain
that in his choice of pieces Berlioz was making
game of some of his contemporaries....</p>

<p>In all the literature on the subject of music
there are no more delightful volumes to be met
with than those of J. B. Weckerlin, called “Musiciana,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>“Nouveau Musiciana,” and “Dernier
Musiciana.” These books are made up of anecdotes,
personal and otherwise. From Bourdelot’s
“Histoire de la Musique” Weckerlin culled the
following: “An equerry of Madame la Dauphine
asked two of the court musicians to his home at
Versailles for dinner one evening. They sang
standing opposite the mantelpiece, over which
hung a great mirror which was broken in six
pieces by the force of tone; all the porcelain on the
buffet resounded and shook.” Weckerlin also recalls
a caprice of Louis XI, who one day commanded
the Abbé de Baigne, who had already invented
many musical instruments, to devise a
harmony out of pigs. The Abbé asked for some
money, which was grudgingly given, and constructed
a pavilion covered with velvet, under
which he placed a number of pigs. Before this
pavilion he arranged a white table with a keyboard
constructed in such a fashion that the displacing
of a key stuck a pig with a needle. The sounds
evoked were out of the ordinary, and it is recorded
that the king was highly diverted and asked for
more. Auber’s enthusiasm for his own music, usually
concealed under an indifferent air, occasionally
expressed itself in strange fashion. Mme.
Damoreau recounted to Weckerlin how, when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>composer completed an air in the middle of the
night, even at three or four o’clock in the morning,
he rushed to her apartment. Dragging a pianoforte
to her bed, he insisted on playing the new
song over and over to her, while she sang it, meanwhile
making the changes suggested by this extraordinary
performance.</p>

<p>More modern instances come to mind. Maria
Gay is not above nose-blowing and expectoration
in her interpretation of Carmen, physical acts in
the public performance of which no Spanish cigarette
girl would probably be caught ashamed.
Yet it may be doubted if they suit the music of
Bizet, or the Meilhac and Halévy version of Merimée’s
creation.... A story has been related to
me—I do not vouch for the truth of it—that
during a certain performance of <i>Carmen</i> at the
Opéra-Comique in Paris a new singer, at some
stage in the proceedings, launched that dreadful
French word which Georges Feydeau so ingenuously
allowed his heroine to project into the second
act of <i>La Dame de chez Maxim</i>, with a result
even more startling than that which attended Bernard
Shaw’s excursion into the realms of the expletive
in his play, <i>Pygmalion</i>. It is further
related of this performance of <i>Carmen</i>, which is
said to have sadly disturbed the “traditions,” that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>in the excitement incident to her début the lady
positively refused to allow Don José to kill her.
Round and round the stage she ran while the perspiring
tenor tried in vain to catch her. At
length, the music of the score being concluded, the
curtain fell on a Carmen still alive; the <i>salle</i> was
in an uproar.</p>

<p>I find I cannot include Chaliapine’s Basilio in my
list of bad mannered stage performances, although
his trumpetings into his handkerchief disturbed
many of New York’s professional writers. <i>Il
Barbiere</i> is a farcical piece, and the music of Rossini
hints at the Rabelaisian humours of the dirty
Spanish priest. In any event, it was the finest
interpretation of the rôle that I have ever seen
or heard and, with the splendid ensemble (Mme.
Sembrich was the Rosina, Mr. Bonci, the count,
and Mr. Campanari, the Figaro), the comedy went
with such joyous abandon (the first act finale to
the accompaniment of roars of laughter from the
stalls) that I am inclined to believe the performance
could not be bettered in this generation.</p>

<p>The late Algernon St. John Brenon used to relate
a history about Emma Eames and a recalcitrant
tenor. The opera was <i>Lohengrin</i>, I believe,
and the question at issue was the position of
a certain couch. Mme. Eames wished it placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>here; the tenor there. As always happens in arguments
concerning a Wagnerian music-drama, at
some point the Bayreuth tradition was invoked,
although I have forgotten whether that tradition
favoured the soprano or her opponent in this instance.
In any case, at the rehearsal the tenor
seemed to have won the battle. When at the performance
he found the couch in the exact spot
which had been designated by the lady his indignation
was all the greater on this account. With
as much regard for the action of the drama as
was consistent with so violent a gesture he gave
the couch a violent shove with his projected toe,
with the intention of pushing it into his chosen
locality. He retired with a howl, nursing a
wounded member. The couch had been nailed to
the floor!</p>

<p>It is related that Marie Delna was discovered
washing dishes at an inn in a small town near
Paris. Her benefactors took her to the capital
and placed her in the Conservatoire. She always
retained a certain peasant obstinacy, and it is said
that during the course of her instruction when she
was corrected she frequently replied, “Je m’en
vais.” Against this phrase argument was unavailing
and Mme. Delna, as a result, acquired a
habit of having her own way. Her Orphée was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>(and still is, I should think) one of the notable
achievements of our epoch. It must have equalled
Pauline Viardot’s performance dramatically, and
transcended it vocally. After singing the part
several hundred times she naturally acquired certain
habits and mannerisms, tricks both of action
and of voice. Still, it is said that when she came
to the Metropolitan Opera House she offered, at a
rehearsal, to defer to Mr. Toscanini’s ideas. He,
the rumour goes, gave his approval to her interpretation
on this occasion. Not so at the performance.
Those who have heard it can never
forget the majesty and beauty of this characterization,
as noble a piece of stage work as we have
seen or heard in our day. At her début in the
part in New York Mme. Delna was superb, vocally
and dramatically. In the celebrated air, <i>Che
faro senza Euridice</i>, the singer followed the tradition,
doubly established by the example of Mme.
Viardot in the great revival of the mid-century,
of singing the different stanzas of the air in different
<i>tempi</i>. In her slowest <i>adagio</i> the conductor
became impatient. He beat his stick briskly
across his desk and whipped up the orchestra.
There was soon a hiatus of two bars between
singer and musicians. It was a terrible moment,
but the singer won the victory. She <i>turned her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>back on the conductor</i> and continued to sing in her
own time. The organ tones rolled out and presently
the audience became aware of a junction
between the two great forces. Mr. Toscanini was
vanquished, but he never forgave her.</p>

<p>During the opera season of 1915-16, opera-goers
were treated to a diverting exhibition.
Mme. Geraldine Farrar, just returned from a
fling at three five-reel cinema dramas, elected to
instil a bit of moving picture realism into <i>Carmen</i>.
Fresh with the memory of her prolonged and brutal
scuffle in the factory scene as it was depicted
on the screen, Mme. Farrar attempted something
like it in the opera, the first act of which was enlivened
with sundry blows and kicks. More serious
still were her alleged assaults on the tenor
(Mr. Caruso) in the third act which, it is said,
resulted in his clutching her like a struggling eel,
to prevent her interference with his next note.
There was even a suggestion of disagreement in
the curtain calls which ensued. All these incidents
of an enlivening evening were duly and impressively
chronicled in the daily press.</p>

<p>There is, of course, Vladimir de Pachmann.
Everybody who has attended his recitals has come
under the spell of his beautiful tone and has been
annoyed by his bad manners. For, curiously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>enough, the two qualities have become inseparable
with him, especially in recent years. Once in Chicago
I saw the strange little pianist sit down in
front of his instrument, rise again, gesticulate,
and leave the stage. Returning with a stage-hand
he pointed to his stool; it was not satisfactory.
A chair was brought in, tried, and found wanting;
more gesticulation—this time wilder. At length,
after considerable discussion between Mr. de Pachmann
and the stage-hand, all in view of the audience,
it was decided that nothing would do but
that some one must fetch the artist’s own piano
bench from his hotel, which, fortunately, adjoined
the concert hall. This was accomplished in the
course of time. In the interval the pianist did not
leave the platform. He sat at the back on the
chair which had been offered him as a substitute
for the offending stool and entertained his audience
with a spectacular series of grimaces.</p>

<p>On another occasion this singular genius arrested
his fingers in the course of a performance of
one of Chopin’s études. His ears were enraptured,
it would seem, by his own rendition of a certain
run; over and over again he played it, now faster,
now more slowly; at times almost slowly enough to
give the student in the front row a glimpse of the
magic fingering. With a sudden change of manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>he announced, “This is the way Godowsky
would play this scale”: great velocity but a dry
tone. Then, “And now Pachmann again!”
The magic fingers stroked the keys.</p>

<p>Even as an auditor de Pachmann sometimes exploits
his eccentricities. Josef Hofmann once
told me the following story: De Pachmann was
sitting in the third row at a concert Rubinstein
gave in his prime. De Pachmann burst into hilarious
laughter, rocking to and fro. Rubinstein
was playing beautifully and de Pachmann’s neighbour,
annoyed, demanded why he was laughing.
De Pachmann could scarcely speak as he pointed
to the pianist on the stage and replied, “He used
the fourth finger instead of the third in that run.
Isn’t it funny?”</p>

<p>I cannot take Vladimir de Pachmann to task for
these amusing bad manners! But they annoy the
<i>bourgeois</i>. We should most of us be glad to have
Oscar Wilde brilliant at our dinner parties, even
though he ate peas with his knife; and Napoleon’s
generalship would have been as effective if he had
been an omnivorous reader of the works of Laura
Jean Libbey. But one must not dwell too long
on de Pachmann. One might be tempted to devote
an entire essay to the relation of his eccentricities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>Another pianist, also a composer, claims attention:
Alberto Savinio. You may find a photolithograph
of Savinio’s autograph manuscript of
<i>Bellovées Fatales, No. 12</i>, in that curious periodical
entitled “291,” the number for April, 1915.
There is a programme, which reads as follows:</p>


<p class="center">LA PASSION DES ROTULES</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>La Femme: Ah! Il m’a touché de sa jambe
de caoutchouc! Ma-ma! Ma-ma!</p>

<p>L’Homme: Tutto s’ha di rosa, Maria,
per te....</p>

<p>La Femme: Ma-ma! Ma-ma!</p>
</div>

<p>There are indications as to how the composer
wishes his music to be played, sometimes <i>glissando</i>
and sometimes “<i>avec des poings</i>.” The rapid and
tortuous passages between the black and white
keys would test the contortionistic qualities of any
one’s fingers. Savinio, it is said, at his appearances
in Paris, actually played until his fingers
<i>bled</i>. When he had concluded, indeed, the ends of
his fingers were crushed and bruised and the keyboard
was red with blood. Albert Gleizes, quoted
by Walter Conrad Arensberg, is my authority for
this bizarre history of music and bad manners.
I have not seen (or heard) Savinio perform. But
when I told this tale to Leo Ornstein he assured me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>that he frequently had had a similar experience.</p>

<p>Romain Rolland in “Jean-Christophe” relates
an incident which is especially interesting because
it has a foundation in fact. Something of the
sort happened to Hugo Wolf when an orchestra
performed his <i>Penthesilea</i> overture for the first
time. It is a curious example of bad manners in
which both the performers and the audience join.</p>

<p>“At last it came to Christophe’s symphony.”
(I am quoting from Gilbert Cannan’s translation.)
“He saw from the way the orchestra and
the people in the hall were looking at his box that
they were aware of his presence. He hid himself.
He waited with the catch at his heart which every
musician feels at the moment when the conductor’s
wand is raised and the waters of the music gather
in silence before bursting their dam. He had
never yet heard his work played. How would the
creatures of his dreams live? How would their
voices sound? He felt their roaring within him;
and he leaned over the abyss of sounds waiting
fearfully for what should come forth.</p>

<p>“What did come forth was a nameless thing, a
shapeless hotchpotch. Instead of the bold columns
which were to support the front of the building
the chords came crumbling down like a building
in ruins; there was nothing to be seen but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>dust of mortar. For a moment Christophe was
not quite sure whether they were really playing his
work. He cast back for the train, the rhythm of
his thoughts; he could not recognize it; it went
on babbling and hiccoughing like a drunken man
clinging close to the wall, and he was overcome
with shame, as though he himself had been seen in
that condition. It was to no avail to think that
he had not written such stuff; when an idiotic interpreter
destroys a man’s thoughts he has always
a moment of doubt when he asks himself in consternation
if he is himself responsible for it. The
audience never asks such a question; the audience
believes in the interpreter, in the singers, in the
orchestra whom they are accustomed to hear, as
they believe in their newspaper; they cannot make
a mistake; if they say absurd things, it is the absurdity
of the author. This audience was the less
inclined to doubt because it liked to believe.
Christophe tried to persuade himself that the <i>Kapellmeister</i>
was aware of the hash and would stop
the orchestra and begin again. The instruments
were not playing together. The horn had missed
his beat and had come in a bar too late; he went on
for a few minutes and then stopped quietly to
clean his instrument. Certain passages for the
oboe had absolutely disappeared. It was impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>for the most skilled ear to pick up the thread
of the musical idea, or even to imagine there was
one. Fantastic instrumentations, humoristic sallies
became grotesque through the coarseness of
the execution. It was lamentably stupid, the work
of an idiot, of a joker who knew nothing of music.
Christophe tore his hair. He tried to interrupt,
but the friend who was with him held him back,
assuring him that the <i>Herr Kapellmeister</i> must
surely see the faults of the execution and would
put everything right—that Christophe must not
show himself and that if he made any remark it
would have a very bad effect. He made Christophe
sit at the very back of the box. Christophe
obeyed, but he beat his head with his fists; and
every fresh monstrosity drew from him a groan of
indignation and misery.</p>

<p>“‘The wretches! The wretches!...’</p>

<p>“He groaned and squeezed his hands tight to
keep from crying out.</p>

<p>“Now mingled with the wrong notes there came
up to him the muttering of the audience, who were
beginning to be restless. At first it was only a
tremor; but soon Christophe was left without a
doubt; they were laughing. The musicians of the
orchestra had given the signal; some of them did
not conceal their hilarity. The audience, certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>then that the music was laughable, rocked with
laughter. This merriment became general; it increased
at the return of a very rhythmical motif
with the double-basses accentuated in a burlesque
fashion. Only the <i>Kapellmeister</i> went on through
the uproar imperturbably beating time.</p>

<p>“At last they reached the end (the best things
come to an end). It was the turn of the audience.
They exploded with delight, an explosion which
lasted for several minutes. Some hissed; others
applauded ironically; the wittiest of all shouted
‘Encore!’ A bass voice coming from a stage box
began to imitate the grotesque motif. Other jokers
followed suit and imitated it also. Some one
shouted ‘Author!’ It was long since these witty
folk had been so highly entertained.</p>

<p>“When the tumult was calmed down a little the
<i>Kapellmeister</i>, standing quite impassive with his
face turned towards the audience, though he was
pretending not to see it (the audience was still
supposed to be non-existent), made a sign to the
audience that he was about to speak. There was
a cry of ‘Ssh,’ and silence. He waited a moment
longer; then (his voice was curt, cold, and cutting):</p>

<p>“‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I should certainly not
have let <i>that</i> be played through to the end if I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>not wished to make an example of the gentleman
who has dared to write offensively of the great
Brahms.’</p>

<p>“That was all; jumping down from his stand he
went out amid cheers from the delighted audience.
They tried to recall him; the applause went on for
a few minutes longer. But he did not return.
The orchestra went away. The audience decided
to go too. The concert was over.</p>

<p>“It had been a good day.”</p>

<p>Von Bülow once stopped his orchestra at a public
performance to remonstrate with a lady with a
fan in the front row of seats. “Madame,” he
said gravely, “I must beg you to cease fanning
yourself in three-four time while I am conducting
in four-four time!”</p>

<p>Here are a few personal recollections of bad
mannered audiences. A performance of <i>The
Magic Flute</i> in Chicago comes to mind. Fritzi
Scheff, the Papagena, and Giuseppe Campanari,
the Papageno, had concluded their duet in the last
act amidst a storm of applause, in face of which
the conductor sped on to the entrance of the Queen
of the Night. Mme. Sembrich entered and sang a
part of her recitative unheard. One could see,
however, that her jaws opened and closed with the
mechanism incidental to tone-production. After
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>a few bars she retired defeated and the bad mannered
audience continued to shout and applaud until
that unspeakable bit of nonsense which runs
“Pa-pa-pa,” etc., was repeated. Mme. Sembrich
appeared no more that day.</p>

<p>Another stormy audience I encountered at a
concert of the Colonne Orchestra in Paris. Those
who sit in the gallery at these concerts at the Chatelet
Theatre are notoriously opinionated. There
the battles of Richard Strauss and Debussy have
been fought. The gallery crowd always comes
early because seats in the top of the house are unreserved.
They cost a franc or two; I forget exactly
how much, but I have often sat there. To
pass the time until the concert begins, and also to
show their indifference to musical literature and
the opinions of others, the galleryites fashion a
curious form of spill, with one end in a point and
the other feathered like an arrow, out of the pages
of the annotated programmes. These are then
sent sailing, in most instances with infinite dexterity
and incredible velocity, over the heads of the
arriving audience. The objective point is the
very centre of the back cloth on the stage, a spot
somewhat above the kettle-drum. A successful
shot always brings forth a round of applause.
But this is (or was) an episode incident to any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>Colonne concert. I am describing an occasion.</p>

<p>The concert took place during the season of
poor Colonne’s final illness (now he lies buried in
that curiously remote avenue of Père-Lachaise
where repose the ashes of Oscar Wilde). Gabriel
Pierné, his successor, had already assumed the bâton,
and he conducted the concert in question.
Anton Van Rooy was the soloist and he had chosen
to sing two very familiar (and very popular in
Paris) Wagner excerpts, Wotan’s Farewell from
<i>Die Walküre</i>, and the air which celebrates the evening
star from <i>Tannhäuser</i>. (In this connection
I might state that in this same winter—1908-9—<i>Das
Rheingold</i> was given <i>in concert form</i>—it
had not yet been performed at the Opéra—on
two consecutive Sundays at the Lamoureux Concerts
in the Salle Gaveau to <i>standing room
only</i>.) The concert proceeded in orderly fashion
until Mr. Van Rooy appeared; then the uproar began.
The gallery hooted, and screamed, and
yelled. All the terrible noises which only a Paris
crowd can invent were hurled from the dark recesses
of that gallery. The din was appalling,
terrifying. Mr. Van Rooy nervously fingered a
sheet of music he held in his hands. Undoubtedly
visions of the first performance of <i>Tannhäuser</i> at
the Paris Opéra passed through his mind. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>may also have considered the possibility of escaping
to the Gare du Nord, with the chance of catching
a train for Germany before the mob could tear
him into bits. Mr. Pierné, who knew his Paris,
faced the crowd, while the audience below peered
up and shuddered, with something of the fright of
the aristocrats during the first days of the Revolution.
Then he held up his hand and, in time,
the modest gesture provoked a modicum of silence.
In that silence some one shrieked out the explanation:
“<i>Tannhäuser</i> avant <i>Walküre</i>.” That was
all. The gallery was not satisfied with the order
of the programme. The readjustment was
quickly made, the parts distributed to the orchestra,
and Mr. Van Rooy sang Wolfram’s air before
Wotan’s. It may be said that never could he
have hoped for a more complete ovation, a more
flattering reception than that which the Parisian
audience accorded him when he had finished. The
applause was veritably deafening.</p>

<p>I have related elsewhere at some length my experiences
at the first Paris performance of Igor
Strawinsky’s ballet, <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i>,
an appeal to primitive emotion through a nerve-shattering
use of rhythm, staged in ultra-modern
style by Waslav Nijinsky. Chords and legs
seemed disjointed. Flying arms synchronized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>marvellously with screaming clarinets. But this
first audience would not permit the composer to
be heard. Cat-calls and hisses succeeded the
playing of the first few bars, and then ensued a
battery of screams, countered by a foil of applause.
We warred over art (some of us thought
it was and some thought it wasn’t). The opposition
was bettered at times; at any rate it was a
more thrilling battle than Strauss conceived between
the Hero and his enemies in <i>Heldenleben</i>
and the celebrated scenes from <i>Die Meistersinger</i>
and <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> could not stand the
comparison. Some forty of the protestants were
forced out of the theatre but that did not quell
the disturbance. The lights in the auditorium
were fully turned on but the noise continued and
I remember Mlle. Piltz executing her strange dance
of religious hysteria on a stage dimmed by the
blazing light in the auditorium, seemingly to the
accompaniment of the disjointed ravings of a
mob of angry men and women. Little by little, at
subsequent performances of the work the audiences
became more mannerly, and when it was given
in concert in Paris the following year it was received
with applause.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may remember the demonstration
directed (supposedly) against American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>singers when the Metropolitan Opera Company invaded
Paris some years ago for a spring season.
The opening opera was <i>Aïda</i>, and all went well until
the first scene of the second act, in which the
reclining Amneris chants her thoughts while her
slaves dance. Here the audience began to give
signs of disapproval, which presently broke out
into open hissing, and finally into a real hullabaloo.
Mme. Homer, nothing daunted, continued
to sing. She afterwards told me that she had
never sung with such force and intensity. And in
a few moments she broke the spell, and calmed the
riot.</p>

<p>Arthur Nikisch once noted that players of the
bassoon were more sensitive than the other members
of his orchestra; he found them subject to
quick fits of temper, and intolerant of criticism.
He attributed this to the delicate mechanism of
the instrument which required the nicest apportionment
of breath. Clarinet players, he discovered,
were less sensitive. One could joke with
them in reason; while horn players were as tractable
as Newfoundland dogs!—A case of a sensitive
pianist comes to mind, brought to bay by as
rude an audience as I can recall. Mr. Paderewski
was playing Beethoven’s C sharp minor sonata at
one of these morning musicales arranged at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>smart hotels so that the very rich may see more intimately
the well-known artists of the concert and
opera stage, when some women started to go out.
In his following number, Couperin’s <i>La Bandoline</i>,
the interruption became intolerable and he stopped
playing. “Those who do not wish to hear me will
kindly leave the room immediately,” he said, “and
those who wish to remain will kindly take their
seats.” The outflow continued, while those who
remained seated began to hiss. “I am astonished
to find people in New York leaving while an artist
is playing,” the pianist added. Then some one
started to applaud; the applause deepened, and
finally Mr. Paderewski consented to play again
and took his place on the bench before his instrument.</p>

<p>The incident was the result of the pianist’s well-known
aversion to appearing in conjunction with
other artists. He had finally agreed to do so on
this occasion provided he would be allowed to play
after the others had concluded their performances.
There had been many recalls for the singer and
violinist who preceded him and it was well after
one o’clock (the concert had begun at eleven) before
he walked on the platform. Now one o’clock
is a very late hour at a fashionable morning musicale.
Some of those present were doubtless hungry;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>others, perhaps, had trains to catch; while
there must have been a goodly number who had
heard all the music they wanted to hear that
morning. There was a very pretty ending to the
incident. Once he had begun, Mr. Paderewski
played for an hour and twenty minutes, and the
faithful ones, who had remained seated, applauded
so much when he finally rose from the bench, even
after he had added several numbers to the printed
programme, that the echoes of the clapping hands
accompanied him to his motor.</p>

<p>I have reserved for the last a description of a
concert given at the Dal Verme Theatre in Milan
by the Italian Futurists. The account is culled
from the “Corriere della Sera” of that city, and
the translation is that which appeared in “International
Music and Drama”:</p>

<p>“At the Dal Verme a Futurist concert of ‘intonarumori’
was to be held last night, but instead
of this there was an uproarious din intoned both
by the public and the Futurists which ended in a
free-for-all fight.</p>

<p>“In a speech which was listened to with sufficient
attention, Marinetti, the poet, announced
that this was to be the first public trial of a new
device invented by Luigi Russelo, a Futurist
painter. This instrument is called the ‘noise-maker’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>and its purpose is to render a new kind of
music. Modern life vibrates with all sorts of
noises; music therefore must render this sensation.
This, in brief, is the idea. In order to develop it
Russelo had invented several types of noise-makers,
each of which renders a different sound.</p>

<p>“After Marinetti’s speech the curtain went up
and the new orchestra appeared in all its glory
amidst the bellowings of the public. The famous
‘noise-intonators’ proved to be made out of a
sort of bass-drum with an immense trumpet attached
to it, the latter looking very much like a
gramaphone horn. Behind the instrument sat the
players, whose only function was to turn the crank
rhythmically in order to create the harmonic
noise. They looked, while performing this agreeable
task, like a squad of knife-grinders. But it
was impossible to hear the music. The public
was unconditionally intolerant. We only caught
here and there a faint buzz and growl. Then
everything was drowned in the billowing seas of
howls, jeers, hisses, and cat-calls. What they
were hissing at, it being impossible to hear the
music, was not quite clear. They hissed just for
the fun of it. It was a case of art for art’s sake.
Painter Russelo, however, continued undisturbed
to direct his mighty battery of musical howitzers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>and his professors kept on grinding their pieces
with a beautiful serenity of mind, all the while
the tumult increasing to redoubtable proportions.
The consequence was that those who went to the
Dal Verme for the purpose of listening to Futurist
music had to give up all hopes and resign themselves
to hear the bedlam of the public.</p>

<p>“In vain did Marinetti attempt to speak, begging
them to be quiet for a while and assuring
them that they would be allowed a whole carnival
of howls at the end of the concert—the public
wanted to hiss and there was no way to check it.
But Russelo kept right on. He conducted with
imperturbable solemnity the three pieces we were
supposed to hear: <i>The Awakening of a Great
City</i>, <i>A Dinner on a Kursaal Terrace</i>, and <i>A Meet
of Automobiles and Aeroplanes</i>. Nobody heard
anything, but Russelo rendered everything conscientiously.
The only thing we were able to find
out about Futurist music is that the noise of the
orchestra is by no means too loud, or at least not
louder than impromptu choruses.</p>

<p>“But the worst was reserved for the middle of
the third piece. The exchange of hot words and
very old-fashioned courtesies had now become
ultra-vivacious and was being punctuated with
several projectiles and an occasional blow. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>this point, Marinetti, Boccioni, Carra, and other
Futurists jumped into the pit and began to distribute
all sorts of blows to the infuriated spectators.
The new Futurist style enables us to
synthesize the scene. Blows. Carbineers. Inspectors.
Cushions and chairs flying about.
Howls. Public standing on chairs. Concert
goes on. More howls, shrieks, curses, and thunderous
insults. Futurists are led back to stage
by gendarmes. Public slowly passes out. Marinetti
and followers pass out before public.
Again howls, invectives, guffaws, and fist blows.
Piazza Cardusio. More blows. Galleria. Ditto.
Futurists enter Savini’s café while pugilistic
matches go merrily on. Mob attempts to storm
stronghold. Iron gates close. Futurists are
shut in, in good condition, save few torn hats.
Mob slowly calms down and disperses. The end.”</p>

<p class="ph2">Music for the Movies</p></div>


<p>Despite the fact that it would seem that
the moving picture drama had opened up
new worlds to the modern musician, no important
composer, so far as I am aware, has as
yet turned his attention to the writing of music
for the films. If the cinema drama is in its infancy,
as some would have us believe, then we may
be sure that the time is not far distant when moving
picture scores will take their places on the
musicians’ book-shelves alongside those of operas,
symphonies, masses, and string quartets. In the
meantime, entirely ignorant of the truth (or oblivious
to it, or merely helpless, as the case may be)
that writing music for moving pictures is a new
art, which demands a new point of view, the directors
of the picture theatres are struggling with
the situation as best they may. Under the circumstances
it is remarkable, on the whole, how
swiftly and how well the demand for music with
the silent drama has been met. Certainly the
music is usually on a level with (or of a better
quality than) the type of entertainment offered.
But the directors have not definitely tackled the
problem; they still continue to try to force old wine
into new bottles, arranging and re-arranging melody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>and harmony which was contrived for quite
other occasions and purposes. Even when scores
have been written for pictures the result has not
shown any imaginative advance over the arranged
score. It is strange, but it has occurred to no one
that the moving picture demands a <i>new</i> kind of
music.</p>

<p>The composers, I should imagine, are only waiting
to be asked to write it. Certainly none of
them has ever shown any hesitancy about composing
incidental music for the spoken drama. Mendelssohn
wrote strains for <i>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</i> which seemed pledged to immortality until
Granville Barker ignored them; the Wedding
March is still in favour in Kankakee and Keokuk.
Beethoven illustrated Goethe’s <i>Egmont</i>; Sir Arthur
Sullivan penned a score for <i>The Tempest</i>;
Schubert was inspired to put down some of his
most ravishing notes for a stupid play called <i>Rosamunde</i>;
Grieg’s <i>Peer Gynt</i> music is more often
performed than the play. More recent instances
of incidental music for dramas are Saint-Saëns’s
score for Brieux’s <i>La Foi</i>, Mascagni’s for <i>The
Eternal City</i>, and Richard Strauss’s for <i>Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme</i>. Is it necessary to continue
the list? I have only, after all, put down a few
of the obvious examples (passing by the thousands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>upon thousands of scores devised by lesser composers
for lesser plays) that would spring at once to
any musician’s mind. Of course it has usually
been the poetic drama (do we ever hear Shakespeare
or Rostand without it?) which has seemed
to call for incidental music but it has accompanied
(with more or less disastrous consequences, to be
sure) the unfolding of many a “drawing-room”
play; especially during the eighties.</p>

<p>When the first moving picture was exposed on
the screen it seems to have occurred to its projector
at once that some kind of music must accompany
its unreeling. The silence evidently appalled
him. A moving picture is not unlike a ballet
in that it depends entirely upon action (it differs
from a ballet in that the action is not necessarily
rhythmic)—and whoever heard of a ballet
performed without music? Sound certainly has
its value in creating an atmosphere and in emphasizing
the “thrill” of the moving picture, especially
when the sound is selected and co-ordinated.
It may also divert the attention. On the whole,
more photographed plays follow the general lines
of <i>Lady Windemere’s Fan</i> or <i>Peg o’ My Heart</i>
than of poetic dramas such as <i>Cymbeline</i> or <i>La
Samaritaine</i>. The problem here, however, is not
the same as in the spoken drama. For in motion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>pictures a poetic play sheds its poetry and becomes,
like its neighbour, a skeleton of action.
There is no conceivable distinction in the “movies”
(beyond one created by preference, or taste,
or the quality of the performance and the photography)
between Dante’s <i>Inferno</i> and a picture in
which the beloved Charles Chaplin looms large.
The directors of the moving picture companies
have tried to meet this problem; that they have
not wholly succeeded so far is not entirely their
fault.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter, for example, in a theatre
in which the films are changed daily (this is the
general rule even in the larger houses), for the musicians
(or musician) to arrange a satisfactory
accompaniment for 5,000 feet of action which
includes everything from an earthquake in Cuba
to a dinner in Park Lane, and it is scarcely possible,
even if the distributors be so inclined (as they
frequently are nowadays) to furnish a music score
which will answer the purposes of the different
sized bands, ranging from a full orchestra to an
upright piano, <i>solo</i>. As for the pictures without
pre-arranged scores, the orchestra leaders and pianists
must do the best they can with them.</p>

<p>In some houses there is an attitude of total disrespect
paid towards the picture by the <i>chef d’orchestre</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>He arranges his musical programme as
if he were giving a concert, not at all with a view
to effectively accompanying the picture. In a
theatre on Second Avenue in New York, for example,
I have heard an orchestra play the whole of
Beethoven’s First Symphony as an accompaniment
to Irene Fenwick’s performance of <i>The Woman
Next Door</i>. As the symphony came to an end before
the picture it was supplemented by a Waldteufel
waltz, <i>Les Patineurs</i>. The result, in this
instance, was not altogether incongruous or even
particularly displeasing, and it occurred to me
that if one had to listen to music while the third
act of <i>Hedda Gabler</i> were being enacted one would
prefer to hear something like Boccherini’s celebrated
minuet or a light Mozart dance rather than
anything ostensibly contrived to fit the situation.
In the latter instance the result would be sure to
be unbearable bathos.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are certain players for
pictures who remind one by their methods of the
anxiety of Richard Strauss to describe every peacock
and bean mentioned in any of his opera-books.
If a garden is exposed on the screen one
hears <i>The Flowers That Bloom in the Spring</i>; a
love scene is the signal for <i>Un Peu d’Amour</i>; a
cross or any religious episode suggests <i>The Rosary</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>to these ingenuous musicians; Japan brings a
touch of <i>Madame Butterfly</i>; a proposal of marriage,
<i>O Promise Me</i>; and a farewell, Tosti’s <i>Good-bye!</i>
This expedient of appealing through the intellect
to the emotions, it may be admitted, has
the stamp of approval of no less a composer than
Richard Wagner.</p>

<p>Lacking the authority of real moving picture
music (which a new composer must rise to invent)
the safest way (not necessarily the <i>best</i> way) is
the middle course—one method for this, another
for that. One of the difficulties is to arrange a
music score for a theatre with a large orchestra,
where the leader must plan his score—or have it
planned for him—for an entire picture before his
orchestra can play a note. Music cues must be
definite: twenty bars of <i>Alexander’s Ragtime Band</i>,
seventeen of <i>The Ride of the Valkyries</i>, ten of <i>Vissi
d’Arte</i>, etc. An ingenious young man has discovered
a way by which music and action may be exactly
synchronized. I feel the impulse to quote extensively
from the somewhat vivid report of his
achievement, published in one of the motion picture
weekly journals: “Here was a man-sized job—how
to measure the action of the picture to the
musical score, so that they would both come out
equal at every part of the picture, and would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>so exact that any orchestra might take the score
and follow the movement of the play with absolute
correctness. It was a question primarily of
mathematics, but even so it was some time before
a system of computation was devised before the
undertaking was gotten down to a certainty. As
an illustration, on the opening night of one of the
most notable photoplay productions now before
the public, the orchestra, notwithstanding a three
weeks’ rehearsal, found at the conclusion of the
picture that it was a page and a half behind the
play’s action in the musical setting.” Then we
learn that Frank Stadler of New York “provided
the remedy for this condition of affairs.” It is
impossible to resist the temptation to quote further
from this extremely racy account. “He remembered
that Beethoven had overcome the difficulty
of proper timing for his sonatas by a mechanical
arrangement known as the metronome,
invented by a friend of his. This is an arrangement
with a little bell attached which may be set
for the movement of the music and used as an
exact guide to the right measure, the bell giving
warning at the expiration of each period so that
the leader knows whether he is in time or not.”
Mr. Stadler then began the measurement of a film
with a metronome, a stenographer, and a watch.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>He found that the film ran ten feet to every eight
seconds and he set the metronome for eight second
periods accordingly. “The stenographer made a
note of the action of the picture each time the
bell rang, with the result that when the entire picture
had been run Mr. Stadler had a complete record
of the production. All that was necessary
then was to select from the classics and the popular
melodies the music which would give a suitable
atmosphere and a harmonious accompaniment to
the theme of the play, so synchronizing the music
with the eight second periods that every bar of it
fitted the spirit of the many score of scenes of the
production.”</p>

<p>The single man orchestra, the player of the upright
piano, need not make so many preparatory
gestures. He may with impunity, if he be of an
inventive turn of mind, or if his memory be good,
improvise his score as the picture unreels itself
for the first time before what may very well be
his astonished vision; and, after that, he may vary
his accompaniment, as the shows of the day progress,
improving it here or there, or not, as the
case may be, keeping generally as near to his original
performance as possible. Of course he puts
a good deal of reliance on rum-ti-tum shivery passages
(known to orchestra leaders as “<i>agits</i>”—an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>abbreviation of <i>agitato</i>; a page or two of them
is distributed to every member of a moving picture
band) to accompany moments of excitement.
This music you will remember if you have ever
attended a performance of a Lincoln J. Carter
melodrama in which a train was wrecked, or a hero
rescued from the teeth of a saw, or a heroine pursued
by bloodhounds. (Those were the good old
days!) Recently I heard a pianist in a moving
picture house on Fourteenth Street in New York
eke out a half-hour with similar poundings on two
or three well used chords (well used even in the
time of Hadyn). The scenes represented the
whole of a two-act opera, and the ambitious pianist
was trying to give his audience the effect of
singers (principals and chorus) and orchestra
with his three chords. (Shades of Arnold Schoenberg!)</p>

<p>A certain periodical devoted to the interests of
the moving picture trade, conducts a department
as first aid to the musical conductors and pianists
who figure at these shows. In a recent number
the editor of this department gives it as his solemn
opinion that musicians who read fiction are the
best equipped for picture playing. Then, with
an almost tragic parenthesis, he continues,
“Reading fiction is the last diversion that the average
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>musician will follow. He feels that all the
necessary romance is to be found in his music.”
Facts are dead, says this editor in substance, but
fiction is living and should make you weep. When
you cry, all that remains for you to do is to think
of a tune which will synchronize with the cause of
your tears; this will serve you later when a similar
scene occurs in a film drama.</p>

<p>There is one tune which any capable moving
picture pianist has found will synchronize with
any Keystone picture (for the benefit of the uninitiated
I may state that in the Keystone farces
some one gets kicked or knocked down or spat
upon several times in almost every scene). I do
not know what the tune is, but wherever Keystone
pictures are shown, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Grand
Rapids, Michigan; Chicago, and even New York,
I have heard it. When a character falls into the
water (and at least ten of them invariably do)
the pianist may vary the tune by sitting on the
piano or by upsetting a chair. In one theatre I
have known him to cause glass to be shattered behind
the screen at a moment when the picture
exposed a similar scene. How Marinetti would
like that!</p>

<p>However, the day of this sort of thing is rapidly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>approaching its close, I venture to say. Some
of the firms are already issuing arranged music
scores for their productions (one may note in
passing the score which accompanied Geraldine
Farrar’s screen performance of <i>Carmen</i>, largely
selected from the music of Bizet’s opera, and Victor
Herbert’s original score for <i>The Fall of a Nation</i>,
a score which does not take full advantage
of the new technique of the cinema drama). It
will not be long before an enterprising director
engages an enterprising musician to compose music
for a picture. For the same reason that d’Annunzio,
very early in the career of the moving
picture, wrote a scenario for a film, I should not
be surprised to learn that Richard Strauss was
under contract to construct an accompaniment to
a screened drama. It will be very loud music and
it will require an orchestra of 143 men to interpret
it and probably the composer himself will conduct
the first performance, and, later, excerpts will be
given by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the
critics will say, in spite of Philip Hale’s diverting
programme notes, that this music should never be
played except in conjunction with the picture for
which it was written. Mascagni is another composer
who should find an excellent field for his talent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>in writing tone-poems for pictures, although
he would contrive nothing more daring than a well-arranged
series of illustrative melodies.</p>

<p>But put Igor Strawinsky, or some other modern
genius, to work on this problem and see what happens!
The musician of the future should revel in
the opportunity the moving picture gives him to
create a new form. This form differs from that
of the incidental music for a play in that the flow
of tone may be continuous and because one never
needs to soften the accompaniment so that the
voices may be heard; it differs from the music for
a ballet in that the scene shifts constantly, and
consequently the time signatures and the mood
and the key must be as constantly shifting. The
swift flash from scene to scene, the “cut-back,”
the necessary rapidity of the action, all are
adapted to inspire the futurist composer to
brilliant effort; a tinkle of this and a smash of
that, without “working-out” or development;
illustration, comment, piquant or serious, that’s
what the new film music should be. The ultimate
moving picture score will be something more than
sentimental accompaniment.</p>

<p>It has seemed to me at times that Oscar Hammerstein
was gifted with almost prophetic
vision. He it was who imagined the glory of
Times (erstwhile Longacre) Square. Theatre
after theatre he fashioned in what was then a
barren district—and presently the crowds and
the hotels came. He foresaw that French opera,
given in the French manner, would be successful
again in New York, and he upset the calculations
of all the wiseacres by making money even with
<i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>, that esoteric collaboration
of Belgian and French art, which in the latter
part of the season of 1907-8 attained a record
of seven performances at the Manhattan Opera
House, all to audiences as vast and as devoted as
those which attend the sacred festivals of <i>Parsifal</i>
at Bayreuth. And he had announced for presentation
during the season of 1908-9 (and again
the following season) a Spanish opera called
<i>Dolores</i>. If he had carried out his intention (why
it was abandoned I have never learned; the scenery
and costumes were ready) he would have had
another honour thrust upon him, that of having
been beforehand in the production of modern
Spanish opera in New York, an honour which, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>the circumstances, must go to Mr. Gatti-Casazza.
(Strictly speaking, <i>Goyescas</i> was not the first
Spanish opera to be given in New York, although
it was the first to be produced at the Metropolitan
Opera House. <i>Il Guarany</i>, by Antonio Carlos
Gomez, a Portuguese born in Brazil, was performed
by the “Milan Grand Opera Company”
during a three weeks’ season at the Star Theatre
in the fall of 1884. An air from this opera is
still in the répertoire of many sopranos. To go
still farther back, two of Manuel Garcia’s operas,
sung of course in Italian, <i>l’Amante Astuto</i> and
<i>La Figlia dell’Aria</i>, were performed at the Park
Theatre in 1825 with Maria Garcia—later to
become the celebrated Mme. Malibran—in the
principal rôles. More recently an itinerant Italian
opéra-bouffe company, which gravitated from
the Park Theatre—not the same edifice that
harboured Garcia’s company!—to various playhouses
on the Bowery, included three zarzuelas
in its répertoire. One of these, the popular <i>La
Gran Via</i>, was announced for performance, but
my records are dumb on the subject and I am not
certain that it was actually given. There are
probably other instances.) Mr. Hammerstein
had previously produced two operas <i>about</i> Spain
when he opened his first Manhattan Opera House
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>on the site now occupied by Macy’s Department
Store with Moszkowski’s <i>Boabdil</i>, quickly followed
by Beethoven’s <i>Fidelio</i>. The malagueña
from <i>Boabdil</i> is still a favourite <i>morceau</i> with
restaurant orchestras, and I believe I have heard
the entire ballet suite performed by the Chicago
Orchestra under the direction of Theodore
Thomas. New York’s real occupation by the
Spaniards, however, occurred after the close of
Mr. Hammerstein’s brilliant seasons, although
the earlier vogue of Carmencita, whose celebrated
portrait by Sargent in the Luxembourg Gallery
in Paris will long preserve her fame, the interest
in the highly-coloured paintings by Sorolla and
Zuloaga, many of which are still on exhibition in
private and public galleries in New York, the success
here achieved, in varying degrees, by such
singing artists as Emilio de Gogorza, Andrea de
Segurola, and Lucrezia Bori, the performances of
the piano works of Albeniz, Turina, and Granados
by such pianists as Ernest Schelling, George
Copeland, and Leo Ornstein, and the amazing
Spanish dances of Anna Pavlowa (who in attempting
them was but following in the footsteps
of her great predecessors of the nineteenth century,
Fanny Elssler and Taglioni), all fanned the
flames.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>
<p>The winter of 1915-16 beheld the Spanish
blaze. Enrique Granados, one of the most distinguished
of contemporary Spanish pianists and
composers, a man who took a keen interest in the
survival, and artistic use, of national forms, came
to this country to assist at the production of his
opera <i>Goyescas</i>, sung in Spanish at the Metropolitan
Opera House for the first time anywhere,
and was also heard several times here in his interpretative
capacity as a pianist; Pablo Casals, the
Spanish ’cellist, gave frequent exhibitions of his
finished art, as did Miguel Llobet, the guitar virtuoso;
La Argentina (Señora Paz of South
America) exposed her ideas, somewhat classicized,
of Spanish dances; a Spanish soprano, Maria
Barrientos, made her North American début and
justified, in some measure, the extravagant reports
which had been spread broadcast about her
singing; and finally the decree of Paris (still valid
in spite of Paul Poiret’s reported absence in the
trenches) led all our womenfolk into the wearing
of Spanish garments, the hip-hoops of the Velasquez
period, the lace flounces of Goya’s Duchess
of Alba, and the mantillas, the combs, and the
<i>accroche-coeurs</i> of Spain, Spain, Spain.... In
addition one must mention Mme. Farrar’s brilliant
success, deserved in some degree, as Carmen, both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>in Bizet’s opera and in a moving picture drama;
Miss Theda Bara’s film appearance in the same
part, made with more atmospheric suggestion
than Mme. Farrar’s, even if less effective as an
interpretation of the moods of the Spanish cigarette
girl; Mr. Charles Chaplin’s eccentric burlesque
of the same play; the continued presence
in New York of Andrea de Segurola as an opera
and concert singer; Maria Gay, who gave some
performances in <i>Carmen</i> and other operas; and
Lucrezia Bori, although she was unable to sing
during the entire season owing to the unfortunate
result of an operation on her vocal cords; in Chicago,
Miss Supervia appeared at the opera and
Mme. Koutznezoff, the Russian, danced Spanish
dances; and at the New York Winter Garden Isabel
Rodriguez appeared in Spanish dances which
quite transcended the surroundings and made that
stage as atmospheric, for the few brief moments in
which it was occupied by her really entrancing
beauty, as a <i>maison de danse</i> in Seville. The
tango, too, in somewhat modified form, continued
to interest “ballroom dancers,” danced to music
provided in many instances by Señor Valverde, an
indefatigable producer of popular tunes, some of
which have a certain value as music owing to their
close allegiance to the folk-dances and songs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>Spain. In the art-world there was a noticeable
revival of interest in Goya and El Greco.</p>

<p>But if Mr. Gatti-Casazza, with the best intentions
in the world, should desire to take advantage
of any of this <i>réclame</i> by producing a series of
Spanish operas at the Metropolitan Opera House—say
four or five more—he would find himself
in difficulty. Where are they? Several of the
operas of Isaac Albeniz have been performed in
London, and in Brussels at the Théâtre de la Monnaie,
but would they be liked here? There is
Felipe Pedrell’s monumental work, the trilogy,
<i>Los Pireneos</i>, called by Edouard Lopez-Chavarri
“the most important work for the theatre written
in Spain”; and there is the aforementioned <i>Dolores</i>.
For the rest, one would have to search
about among the zarzuelas; and would the Metropolitan
Opera House be a suitable place for the
production of this form of opera? It is doubtful,
indeed, if the zarzuela could take root in any
theatre in New York.</p>

<p>The truth is that in Spain Italian and German
operas are much more popular than Spanish,
the zarzuela always excepted; and at Señor
Arbós’s series of concerts at the Royal Opera in
Madrid one hears more Bach and Beethoven than
Albeniz and Pedrell. There is a growing interest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>in music in Spain and there are indications that
some day her composers may again take an important
place with the musicians of other nationalities,
a place they proudly held in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However,
no longer ago than 1894, we find Louis Lombard
writing in his “Observations of a Musician” that
harmony was not taught at the Conservatory of
Malaga, and that at the closing exercises of the
Conservatory of Barcelona he had heard a four-hand
arrangement of the <i>Tannhäuser</i> march performed
on ten pianos by forty hands! Havelock
Ellis (“The Soul of Spain,” 1909) affirms that
a concert in Spain sets the audience to chattering.
They have a savage love of noise, the Spanish,
he says, which incites them to conversation.
Albert Lavignac, in “Music and Musicians”
(William Marchant’s translation), says, “We
have left in the shade the Spanish school, which
to say truth does not exist.” But if one reads
what Lavignac has to say about Moussorgsky,
one is likely to give little credence to such extravagant
generalities as the one just quoted.
The Moussorgsky paragraph is a gem, and I am
only too glad to insert it here for the sake of
those who have not seen it: “A charming and
fruitful melodist, who makes up for a lack of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>skill in harmonization by a daring, which is sometimes
of doubtful taste; has produced songs,
piano music in small amount, and an opera, <i>Boris
Godunow</i>.” In the report of the proceedings of
the thirty-fourth session of the London Musical
Association (1907-8) Dr. Thomas Lea Southgate
is quoted as complaining to Sir George Grove
because under “Schools of Composition” in the
old edition of Grove’s Dictionary the Spanish
School was dismissed in twenty lines. Sir George,
he says, replied, “Well, I gave it to Rockstro
because nobody knows anything about Spanish
music.”—The bibliography of modern Spanish
music is indeed indescribably meagre, although a
good deal has been written in and out of Spain
about the early religious composers of the Iberian
peninsula.</p>

<p>These matters will be discussed in due course.
In the meantime it has afforded me some amusement
to put together a list (which may be of
interest to both the casual reader and the student
of music) of compositions suggested by Spain
to composers of other nationalities. (This list is
by no means complete. I have not attempted
to include in it works which are not more or
less familiar to the public of the present day;
without boundaries it could easily be extended into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>a small volume.) The répertoire of the concert
room and the opera house is streaked through and
through with Spanish atmosphere and, on the
whole, I should say, the best Spanish music has
not been written by Spaniards, although most of
it, like the best music written in Spain, is based
primarily on the rhythm of folk-tunes, dances and
songs. Of orchestral pieces I think I must put
at the head of the list Chabrier’s rhapsody,
<i>España</i>, as colourful and rhythmic a combination
of tone as the auditor of a symphony concert is
often bidden to hear. It depends for its melody
and rhythm on two Spanish dances, the jota, fast
and fiery, and the malagueña, slow and sensuous.
These are true Spanish tunes; Chabrier, according
to report, invented only the rude theme given
to the trombones. The piece was originally written
for piano, and after Chabrier’s death was
transformed (with other music by the same composer)
into a ballet, <i>España</i>, performed at the
Paris Opera, 1911. Waldteufel based one of his
most popular waltzes on the theme of this rhapsody.
Chabrier’s <i>Habanera</i> for the pianoforte
(1885) was his last musical reminiscence of his
journey to Spain. It is French composers
generally who have achieved better effects with
Spanish atmosphere than men of other nations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>and next to Chabrier’s music I should put Debussy’s
<i>Iberia</i>, the second of his <i>Images</i> (1910).
It contains three movements designated respectively
as “In the streets and roads,” “The perfumes
of the night,” and “The morning of a
fête-day.” It is indeed rather the smell and the
look of Spain than the rhythm that this music
gives us, entirely impressionistic that it is, but
rhythm is not lacking, and such characteristic
instruments as castanets, tambourines, and xylophones
are required by the score. “Perfumes of
the night” comes as near to suggesting odours
to the nostrils as any music can—and not all of
them are pleasant odours. There is Rimsky-Korsakow’s
<i>Capriccio Espagnole</i>, with its <i>alborado</i>
or lusty morning serenade, its long series of
cadenzas (as cleverly written as those of <i>Scheherazade</i>
to display the virtuosity of individual
players in the orchestra; it is noteworthy that
this work is dedicated to the sixty-seven musicians
of the band at the Imperial Opera House of
Petrograd and all of their names are mentioned
on the score) to suggest the vacillating music of
a gipsy encampment, and finally the wild fandango
of the Asturias with which the work comes
to a brilliant conclusion. Engelbert Humperdinck
taught the theory of music in the Conservatory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>of Barcelona for two years (1885-6), and
one of the results was his <i>Maurische Rhapsodie</i>
in three parts (1898-9), still occasionally performed
by our orchestras. Lalo wrote his <i>Symphonie
Espagnole</i> for violin and orchestra for the
great Spanish virtuoso, Pablo de Sarasate, but
all our violinists delight to perform it (although
usually shorn of a movement or two). Glinka
wrote a <i>Jota Aragonese</i> and <i>A Night in Madrid</i>;
he gave a Spanish theme to Balakirew which the
latter utilized in his <i>Overture on a theme of a
Spanish March</i>. Liszt wrote a <i>Spanish Rhapsody</i>
for pianoforte (arranged as a concert piece
for piano and orchestra by Busoni) in which he
used the jota of Aragon as a theme for variations.
Rubinstein’s <i>Toreador and Andalusian</i>
and Moszkowski’s <i>Spanish Dances</i> (for four
hands) are known to all amateur pianists as
Hugo Wolf’s <i>Spanisches Liederbuch</i> and Robert
Schumann’s <i>Spanisches Liederspiel</i>, set to F.
Giebel’s translations of popular Spanish ballads,
are known to all singers. I have heard a song
of Saint-Saëns, <i>Guitares et Mandolines</i>, charmingly
sung by Greta Torpadie, in which the instruments
of the title, under the subtle fingers of that
masterly accompanist, Coenraad V. Bos, were
cleverly imitated. And Debussy’s <i>Mandoline</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>Delibes’s <i>Les Filles de Cadiz</i> (which in this country
belongs both to Emma Calvé and Olive Fremstad)
spring instantly to mind. Ravel’s <i>Rapsodie
Espagnole</i> is as Spanish as music could be.
The Boston Symphony men have played it during
the season just past. Ravel based the habanera
section of his <i>Rapsodie</i> on one of his piano pieces.
But Richard Strauss’s two tone-poems on Spanish
subjects, <i>Don Juan</i> and <i>Don Quixote</i>, have not a
note of Spanish colouring, so far as I can remember,
from beginning to end. Svendsen’s symphonic
poem, <i>Zorahayda</i>, based on a passage in
Washington Irving’s “Alhambra,” is Spanish in
theme and may be added to this list together with
Waldteufel’s <i>Estudiantina</i> waltzes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Four modern operas stand out as Spanish in
subject and atmosphere. I would put at the top
of the list Zandonai’s <i>Conchita</i>; the Italian composer
has caught on his musical palette and transferred
to his tonal canvas a deal of the lazy restless
colour of the Iberian peninsula in this little
master-work. The feeling of the streets and patios
is admirably caught. My friend, Pitts Sanborn,
said of it, after its solitary performance at
the Metropolitan Opera House in New York by
the Chicago Opera Company, “There is musical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>atmosphere of a rare and penetrating kind; there
is colour used with the discretion of a master;
there are intoxicating rhythms, and above the orchestra
the voices are heard in a truthful musical
speech.... Ever since <i>Carmen</i> it has been so
easy to write Spanish music and achieve supremely
the banal. Here there is as little of the Spanish
of convention as in Debussy’s <i>Iberia</i>, but there is
Spain.” This opera, based on Pierre Louys’s
sadic novel, “La Femme et le Pantin,” owed some
of its extraordinary impression of vitality to the
vivid performance given of the title-rôle by Tarquinia
Tarquini. Raoul Laparra, born in Bordeaux,
but who has travelled much in Spain, has
written two Spanish operas, <i>La Habanera</i> and <i>La
Jota</i>, both named after popular Spanish dances
and both produced at the Opéra-Comique in
Paris. I have heard <i>La Habanera</i> there and
found the composer’s use of the dance as a pivot
of a tragedy very convincing. Nor shall I forget
the first act-close, in which a young man, seated
on a wall facing the window of a house where a
most bloody murder has been committed, sings a
wild Spanish ditty, accompanying himself on the
guitar, crossing and recrossing his legs in complete
abandonment to the rhythm, while in the
house rises the wild treble cry of a frightened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>child. I have not heard <i>La Jota</i>, nor have I seen
the score. I do not find Emile Vuillermoz enthusiastic
in his review (“S. I. M.,” May 15, 1911):
“Une danse transforme le premier acte en un
kaléidoscope frénétique et le combat dans l’église
doit donner, au second, dans l’intention de l’auteur
‘une sensation à pic, un peu comme celle d’un
puits où grouillerait la besogne monstreuse de
larves humaines.’ A vrai dire ces deux tableaux de
cinématographe papillotant, corsés de cris, de
hurlements et d’un nombre incalculable de coups de
feu constituent pour le spectateur une épreuve physiquement
douloureuse, une hallucination confuse
et inquiétante, un cauchemar assourdissant qui le
conduisent irrésistiblement à l’hébétude et à la
migraine. Dans tout cet enfer que devient la
musique?” Perhaps opera-goers in general are
not looking for thrills of this order; the fact remains
that <i>La Jota</i> has had a modest career when
compared with <i>La Habanera</i>, which has even been
performed in Boston. <i>Carmen</i> is essentially a
French opera; the leading emotions of the characters
are expressed in an idiom as French as that
of Gounod; yet the dances and entr’actes are
Spanish in colour. The story of Carmen’s entrance
song is worth retelling in Mr. Philip Hale’s
words (“Boston Symphony Orchestra Programme
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>Notes”; 1914-15, P. 287): “Mme. Galli-Marié
disliked her entrance air, which was in 6-8 time
with a chorus. She wished something more audacious,
a song in which she could bring into play
the whole battery of her <i>perversités artistiques</i>,
to borrow Charles Pigot’s phrase: ‘caressing
tones and smiles, voluptuous inflections, killing
glances, disturbing gestures.’ During the rehearsals
Bizet made a dozen versions. The singer
was satisfied only with the thirteenth, the now familiar
Habanera, based on an old Spanish tune
that had been used by Sebastian Yradier. This
brought Bizet into trouble, for Yradier’s publisher,
Heugel, demanded that the indebtedness
should be acknowledged in Bizet’s score. Yradier
made no complaint, but to avoid a lawsuit or a
scandal, Bizet gave consent, and on the first page
of the Habanera in the French edition of <i>Carmen</i>
this line is engraved: ‘Imitated from a Spanish
song, the property of the publishers of <i>Le Ménestrel</i>.’”</p>

<p>There are other operas the scenes of which are
laid in Spain. Some of them make an attempt
at Spanish colouring, more do not. Massenet
wrote no less than five operas on Spanish subjects,
<i>Le Cid</i>, <i>Cherubin</i>, <i>Don César de Bazan</i>, <i>La Navarraise</i>
and <i>Don Quichotte</i> (Cervantes’s novel has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>frequently lured the composers of lyric dramas
with its story; Clément et Larousse give a long
list of <i>Don Quixote</i> operas, but they do not include
one by Manuel Garcia, which is mentioned in John
Towers’s compilation, “Dictionary-Catalogue of
Operas.” However, not a single one of these lyric
dramas has held its place on the stage). The
Spanish dances in <i>Le Cid</i> are frequently performed,
although the opera is not. The most famous of
the set is called simply <i>Aragonaise</i>; it is not a jota.
<i>Pleurez, mes yeux</i>, the principal air of the piece,
can scarcely be called Spanish. There is a delightful
suggestion of the jota in <i>La Navarraise</i>.
In <i>Don Quichotte</i> la belle Dulcinée sings one of her
airs to her own guitar strummings, and much was
made of the fact, before the original production at
Monte Carlo, of Mme. Lucy Arbell’s lessons on
that instrument. Mary Garden, who had learned
to dance for <i>Salome</i>, took no guitar lessons for
<i>Don Quichotte</i>. But is not the guitar an anachronism
in this opera? In a pamphlet by Señor
Cecilio de Roda, issued during the celebration of
the tercentenary of the publication of Cervantes’s
romance, taking as its subject the musical references
in the work, I find, “The harp was the aristocratic
instrument most favoured by women and
it would appear to be regarded in <i>Don Quixote</i> as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>the feminine instrument par excellence.” Was
the guitar as we know it in existence at that
epoch? I think the <i>vihuela</i> was the guitar of the
period.... Maurice Ravel wrote a Spanish opera,
<i>L’heure Espagnole</i> (one act, performed at
the Paris Opéra-Comique, 1911). Octave Séré
(“Musiciens français d’Aujourd’hui”) says of it:
“Les principaux traits de son caractère et l’influence
du sol natal s’y combinent étrangement. De
l’alliance de la mer et du Pays Basque (Ravel was
born in the Basses-Pyrénées, near the sea) est née
une musique à la fois fluide et nerveusement rythmée,
mobile, chatoyante, amie du pittoresque et
dont le trait net et précis est plus incisif que profond.”
Hugo Wolf’s opera <i>Der Corregidor</i> is
founded on the novel, “Il Sombrero de tres Picos,”
of the Spanish writer, Pedro de Alarcon (1833-91).
His unfinished opera <i>Manuel Venegas</i> also
has a Spanish subject, suggested by Alarcon’s “El
Nino de la Bola.” Other Spanish operas are Beethoven’s
<i>Fidelio</i>, Balfe’s <i>The Rose of Castille</i>, Verdi’s
<i>Ernani</i> and <i>Il Trovatore</i>, Rossini’s <i>Il Barbiere
di Siviglia</i>, Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i> and <i>Le Nozze
di Figaro</i>, Weber’s <i>Preciosa</i> (really a play with incidental
music), Dargomijsky’s <i>The Stone Guest</i>
(Pushkin’s version of the Don Juan story. This
opera, by the way, was one of the many retouched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>and completed by Rimsky-Korsakow), Reznicek’s
<i>Donna Diana</i>—and Wagner’s <i>Parsifal</i>! The
American composer John Knowles Paine’s opera
<i>Azara</i>, dealing with a Moorish subject, has, I
think, never been performed.</p>


<p class="ph3">II</p>

<p>The early religious composers of Spain deserve
a niche all to themselves, be it ever so tiny, as in
the present instance. There is, to be sure, some
doubt as to whether their inspiration was entirely
peninsular, or whether some of it was wafted from
Flanders, and the rest gleaned in Rome, for in
their service to the church most of them migrated
to Italy and did their best work there. It is not
the purpose of the present chronicler to devote
much space to these early men, or to discuss in detail
their music. There are no books in English
devoted to a study of Spanish music, and few in
any language, but what few exist take good care
to relate at considerable length (some of them with
frequent musical quotation) the state of music in
Spain in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries, the golden period. To the reader who
may wish to pursue this phase of our subject I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>offer a small bibliography. There is first of all
A. Soubies’s two volumes, “Histoire de la Musique
d’Espagne,” published in 1889. The second
volume takes us through the eighteenth century.
The religious and early secular composers are
catalogued in these volumes, but there is little attempt
at detail, and he is a happy composer who
is awarded an entire page. Soubies does not find
occasion to pause for more than a paragraph on
most of his subjects. Occasionally, however, he
lightens the plodding progress of the reader, as
when he quotes Father Bermudo’s “Declaracion
de Instrumentos” (1548; the 1555 edition is in
the Library of Congress at Washington):
“There are three kinds of instruments in music.
The first are called natural; these are men, of
whom the song is called <i>musical harmony</i>. Others
are artificial and are played by the touch—such
as the harp, the <i>vihuela</i> (the ancient guitar, which
resembles the lute), and others like them; the
music of these is called <i>artificial</i> or rhythmic. The
third species is pneumatique and includes instruments
such as the flute, the douçaine (a species of
oboe), and the organ.” There may be some to
dispute this ingenious and highly original classification.
The best known, and perhaps the most
useful (because it is easily accessible) history of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>Spanish music is that written by Mariano Soriano
Fuertes, in four volumes: “Historia de la Música
Española desde la venida de los Fenicios hasta el
año de 1850”; published in Barcelona and Madrid
in 1855. There is further the “Diccionario Tecnico,
Historico, y Biografico de la Música,” by
Jose Parada y Barreto (Madrid, 1867). This,
of course, is a general work on music, but Spain
gets her full due. For example, a page and a half
is devoted to Beethoven, and nine pages to Eslava.
It is to this latter composer to whom we must turn
for the most complete and important work on
Spanish church music: “Lira Sacro-Hispana”
(Madrid, 1869), in ten volumes, with voluminous
extracts from the composers’ works. This collection
of Spanish church music from the sixteenth
century through the eighteenth, with biographical
notices of the composers is out of print and rare
(there is a copy in the Congressional Library at
Washington). As a complement to it I may mention
Felipe Pedrell’s “Hispaniae Schola Música
Sacra,” begun in 1894, which has already reached
the proportions of Eslava’s work. Pedrell, who
was the master of Enrique Granados, has also issued
a fine edition of the music of Victoria.</p>

<p>The Spanish composers had their full share in
the process of crystallizing music into forms of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>permanent beauty during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Rockstro asserts that during
the early part of the sixteenth century nearly all
the best composers for the great Roman choirs
were Spaniards. But their greatest achievement
was the foundation of the school of which Palestrina
was the crown. On the music of their own
country their influence is less perceptible. I think
the name of Cristofero Morales (1512-53) is the
first important name in the history of Spanish
music. He preceded Palestrina in Rome and
some of his masses and motets are still sung in the
Papal chapel there (and in other Roman Catholic
edifices and by choral societies). Francesco
Guerrero (1528-99; these dates are approximate)
was a pupil of Morales. He wrote settings of the
Passion choruses according to St. Matthew and
St. John and numerous masses and motets.
Tomas Luis de Victoria is, of course, the greatest
figure in Spanish music, and next to Palestrina
(with whom he worked contemporaneously) the
greatest figure in sixteenth century music. Soubies
writes: “One might say that on his musical
palette he has entirely at his disposition, in some
sort, the glowing colour of Zurbaran, the realistic
and transparent tones of Velasquez, the ideal
shades of Juan de Juarez and Murillo. His mysticism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>is that of Santa Theresa and San Juan de
la Cruz.” The music of Victoria is still very
much alive and may be heard even in New York,
occasionally, through the medium of the Musical
Art Society. Whether it is performed in churches
in America or not I do not know; the Roman choirs
still sing it....</p>

<p>The list might be extended indefinitely ... but
the great names I have given. There are Cabezon,
whom Pedrell calls the “Spanish Bach,” Navarro,
Caseda, Comes, Ribera, Castillo, Lobo, Duron,
Romero, Juarez. On the whole I think these
composers had more influence on Rome—the
Spanish nature is more reverent than the Italian—than
on Spain. The modern Spanish composers
have learned more from the folk-song and
dance than they have from the church composers.
However, there are voices which dissent from this
opinion. G. Tebaldini (“Rivista Musicale,” Vol.
IV, Pp. 267 and 494) says that Pedrell in his
studies learned much which he turned to account in
the choral writing of his operas. And Felipe Pedrell
himself asserts that there is an unbroken chain
between the religious composers of the sixteenth
century and the theatrical composers of the seventeenth.
We may follow him thus far without
believing that the theatrical composers of the seventeenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>century had too great an influence on the
secular composers of the present day.</p>


<p class="ph3">III</p>

<p>All the world dances in Spain, at least it would
seem so, in reading over the books of the Marco
Polos who have made voyages of discovery on the
Iberian peninsula. Guitars seem to be as common
there as pea-shooters in New England, and strumming
seems to set the feet a-tapping and voices
a-singing, what, they care not. (Havelock Ellis
says: “It is not always agreeable to the Spaniard
to find that dancing is regarded by the foreigner
as a peculiar and important Spanish institution.
Even Valera, with his wide culture, could
not escape this feeling; in a review of a book about
Spain by an American author entitled ‘The Land
of the Castanet’—a book which he recognized as
full of appreciation for Spain—Valera resented
the title. It is, he says, as though a book about
the United States should be called ‘The Land of
Bacon.’”) Oriental colour is streaked through
and through the melodies and harmonies, many of
which betray their Arabian origin; others are
<i>flamenco</i>, or gipsy. The dances, almost invariably
accompanied by song, are generally in 3-4
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>time or its variants such as 6-8 or 3-8; the tango,
of course, is in 2-4. But the dancers evolve the
most elaborate inter-rhythms out of these simple
measures, creating thereby a complexity of effect
which defies any comprehensible notation on paper.
As it is on this <i>fioriture</i>, if I may be permitted
to use the word in this connection, of the
dancer that the sophisticated composer bases some
of his most natural and national effects, I shall
linger on the subject. La Argentina has re-arranged
many of the Spanish dances for purposes
of the concert stage, but in her translation she has
retained in a large measure this interesting complication
of rhythm, marking the irregularity of
the beat, now with a singularly complicated detonation
of heel-tapping, now with a sudden bend
of a knee, now with the subtle quiver of an eyelash,
now with a shower of castanet sparks (an instrument
which requires a hard tutelage for its
complete mastery; Richard Ford tells us that even
the children in the streets of Spain rap shells together,
to become self-taught artists in the use of
it). Chabrier, in his visit to Spain with his wife
in 1882, attempted to note down some of these
rhythmic variations achieved by the dancers while
the musicians strummed their guitars, and he was
partially successful. But all in all he only succeeded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>in giving in a single measure each variation;
he did not attempt to weave them into the
intricate pattern which the Spanish women contrive
to make of them.</p>

<p>There is a singular similarity to be observed between
this heel-tapping and the complicated drum-tapping
of the African negroes of certain tribes.
In his book “Afro-American Folksongs” H. E.
Krehbiel thus describes the musical accompaniment
of the dances in the Dahoman Village at
the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago:
“These dances were accompanied by choral song
and the rhythmical and harmonious beating of
drums and bells, the song being in unison. The
harmony was a tonic major triad broken up
rhythmically in a most intricate and amazingly ingenious
manner. The instruments were tuned
with excellent justness. The fundamental tone
came from a drum made of a hollowed log about
three feet long with a single head, played by one
who seemed to be the leader of the band, though
there was no giving of signals. This drum was
beaten with the palms of the hands. A variety of
smaller drums, some with one, some with two
heads, were beaten variously with sticks and fingers.
The bells, four in number, were of iron and
were held mouth upward and struck with sticks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>The players showed the most remarkable rhythmical
sense and skill that ever came under my notice.
Berlioz in his supremest effort with his
army of drummers produced nothing to compare
in artistic interest with the harmonious drumming
of these savages. The fundamental effect was a
combination of double and triple time, the former
kept by the singers, the latter by the drummers,
but it is impossible to convey the idea of the
wealth of detail achieved by the drummers by
means of exchange of the rhythms, syncopation of
both simultaneously, and dynamic devices. Only
by making a score of the music could this have
been done. I attempted to make such a score by
enlisting the help of the late John C. Filmore, experienced
in Indian music, but we were thwarted
by the players who, evidently divining our purpose
when we took out our notebooks, mischievously
changed their manner of playing as soon as we
touched pencil to paper.”</p>

<p>The resemblance between negro and Spanish
music is very noticeable. Mr. Krehbiel says that
in South America Spanish melody has been imposed
on negro rhythm. In the dances of the people
of Spain, as Chabrier points out, the melody
is often practically nil; the effect is rhythmic (an
effect which is emphasized by the obvious harmonic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>and melodic limitations of the guitar, which invariably
accompanies all singers and dancers).
If there were a melody or if the guitarists played
well (which they usually do not) one could not
distinguish its contours what with the cries of Olè!
and the heel-beats of the performers. Spanish
melodies, indeed, are often scraps of tunes, like
the African negro melodies. The habanera is a
true African dance, taken to Spain by way of
Cuba, as Albert Friedenthal points out in his book,
“Musik, Tanz, und Dichtung bei den Kreolen
Amerikas.” Whoever was responsible, Arab, negro,
or Moor (Havelock Ellis says that the dances
of Spain are closely allied with the ancient dances
of Greece and Egypt), the Spanish dances betray
their oriental origin in their complexity of rhythm
(a complexity not at all obvious on the printed
page, as so much of it depends on dancer, guitarist,
singer, and even public!), and the <i>fioriture</i>
which decorate their melody when melody occurs.
While Spanish religious music is perhaps not distinctively
Spanish, the dances invariably display
marked national characteristics; it is on these,
then (some in greater, some in less degree), that
the composers in and out of Spain have built their
most atmospheric inspirations, their best pictures
of popular life in the Iberian peninsula. A good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>deal of the interest of this music is due to the important
part the guitar plays in its construction;
the modulations are often contrary to all rules of
harmony and (yet, some would say) the music
seems to be effervescent with variety and fire. Of
the guitarists Richard Ford (“Gatherings from
Spain”) says: “The performers seldom are
very scientific musicians; they content themselves
with striking the chords, sweeping the whole hand
over the strings, or flourishing, and tapping the
board with the thumb, at which they are very expert.
Occasionally in the towns there is some
one who has attained more power over this ungrateful
instrument; but the attempt is a failure.
The guitar responds coldly to Italian words and
elaborate melody, which never come home to Spanish
ears or hearts.” (An exception must be made
in the case of Miguel Llobet. I first heard him
play at Pitts Sanborn’s concert at the Punch and
Judy Theatre (April 17, 1916) for the benefit of
Hospital 28 in Bourges, France, and he made a
deep impression on me. In one of his numbers,
the <i>Spanish Fantasy</i> of Tárrega, he astounded
and thrilled me. He seemed at all times to exceed
the capacity of his instrument, obtaining a variety
of colour which was truly amazing. In this particular
number he not only plucked the keyboard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>but the fingerboard as well, in intricate and rapid
<i>tempo</i>; seemingly two different kinds of instruments
were playing. But at all times he variated
his tone; sometimes he made the instrument sound
almost as though it had been played by wind and
not plucked. Especially did I note a suggestion
of the bagpipe. A true artist. None of the music,
the fantasy mentioned, a serenade of Albeniz,
and a Menuet of Tor, was particularly interesting,
although the Fantasia contained some fascinating
references to folk-dance tunes. There is
nothing sensational about Llobet, a quiet prim
sort of man; he sits quietly in his chair and makes
music. It might be a harp or a ’cello—no striving
for personal effect.)</p>

<p>The Spanish dances are infinite in number and
for centuries back they seem to form part and
parcel of Spanish life. Discussion as to how they
are danced is a feature of the descriptions. No
two authors agree, it would seem; to a mere annotator
the fact is evident that they are danced
differently on different occasions. It is obvious
that they are danced differently in different provinces.
The Spaniards, as Richard Ford points
out, are not too willing to give information to
strangers, frequently because they themselves lack
the knowledge. Their statements are often misleading,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>sometimes intentionally so. They do not
understand the historical temperament. Until recently
many of the art treasures and archives of
the peninsula were but poorly kept. Those who
lived in the shadow of the Alhambra admired only
its shade. It may be imagined that there has been
even less interest displayed in recording the folk-dances.
“Dancing in Spain is now a matter
which few know anything about,” writes Havelock
Ellis, “because every one takes it for granted
that he knows all about it; and any question on
the subject receives a very ready answer which is
usually of questionable correctness.” Of the music
of the dances we have many records, and that
they are generally in 3-4 time or its variants we
may be certain. As to whether they are danced
by two women, a woman and a man, or a woman
alone, the authorities do not always agree. The
confusion is added to by the oracular attitude of
the scribes. It seems quite certain to me that this
procedure varies. That the animated picture almost
invariably possesses great fascination there
are only too many witnesses to prove. I myself
can testify to the marvel of some of them, set to
be sure in strange frames, the Feria in Paris, for
example; but even without the surroundings, which
Spanish dances demand, the diablerie, the shivering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>intensity of these fleshly women, always wound
tight with such shawls as only the mistresses of
kings might wear in other countries, have drawn
taut the <i>real thrill</i>. It is dancing which enlists the
co-operation not only of the feet and legs, but of
the arms and, in fact, the entire body.</p>

<p>The smart world in Spain to-day dances much
as the smart world does anywhere else, although it
does not, I am told, hold a brief for our tango,
which Mr. Krehbiel suggests is a corruption of the
original African habanera. But in older days
many of the dances, such as the pavana, the sarabande,
and the gallarda, were danced at the court
and were in favour with the nobility. (Although
presumably of Italian origin, the pavana and gallarda
were more popular in Spain than in Rome.
Fuertes says that the sarabande was invented in
the middle of the sixteenth century by a dancer
called Zarabanda who was a native of either Seville
or Guayaquil.) The pavana, an ancient dance of
grave and stately measure, was much in vogue in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. An explanation
of its name is that the figures executed
by the dancers bore a resemblance to the semi-circular
wheel-like spreading of the tail of a peacock.
The gallarda (French, gaillard) was usually
danced as a relief to the pavana (and indeed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>often follows it in the dance-suites of the classical
composers in which these forms all figure). The
jacara, or more properly xacara, of the sixteenth
century, was danced in accompaniment to a romantic,
swashbuckling ditty. The Spanish folias
were a set of dances danced to a simple tune treated
in a variety of styles with very free accompaniment
of castanets and bursts of song. Corelli in
Rome in 1700 published twenty-four variations in
this form, which have been played in our day by
Fritz Kreisler and other violinists.</p>

<p>The names of the modern Spanish dances are
often confused in the descriptions offered by observing
travellers, for the reasons already noted.
Hundreds of these descriptions exist, and it is difficult
to choose the most telling of them. Gertrude
Stein, who has spent the last two years in Spain,
has noted the rhythm of several of these dances by
the mingling of her original use of words with the
ingratiating medium of <i>vers libre</i>. She has succeeded,
I think, better than some musicians in suggesting
the intricacies of the rhythm. I should
like to transcribe one of these attempts here, but
that I have not the right to do as I have only seen
them in manuscript; they have not yet appeared in
print. These pieces are in a sense the thing itself—I
shall have to fall back on descriptions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>the thing. The tirana, a dance common to the
province of Andalusia, is accompanied by song.
It has a decided rhythm, affording opportunities
for grace and gesture, the women toying with their
aprons, the men flourishing hats and handkerchiefs.
The polo, or olè, is now a gipsy dance.
Mr. Ellis asserts that it is a corruption of the
sarabande! He goes on to say, “The so-called
gipsy dances of Spain are Spanish dances which
the Spaniards are tending to relinquish but which
the gipsies have taken up with energy and skill.”
(This theory might be warmly contested.) The
bolero, a comparatively modern dance, came to
Spain through Italy. Mr. Philip Hale points out
the fact that the bolero and the cachucha (which,
by the way, one seldom hears of nowadays) were
the popular Spanish dances when Mesdames Faviani
and Dolores Tesrai, and their followers, Mlle.
Noblet and Fanny Elssler, visited Paris. Fanny
Elssler indeed is most frequently seen pictured in
Spanish costume, and the cachucha was danced by
her as often, I fancy, as Mme. Pavlowa dances <i>Le
Cygne</i> of Saint-Saëns. Anna de Camargo, who
acquired great fame as a dancer in France in the
early eighteenth century, was born in Brussels but
was of Spanish descent. She relied, however, on
the Italian classic style for her success rather than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>on national Spanish dances. The seguidilla is a
gipsy dance which has the same rhythm as the
bolero but is more animated and stirring. Examples
of these dances, and of the jota, fandango,
and the sevillana, are to be met with in the compositions
listed in the first section of this article, in
the appendices of Soriano Fuertes’s “History of
Spanish Music,” in Grove’s Dictionary, in the
numbers of “S. I. M.” in which the letters of Emmanuel
Chabrier occur, and in collections made by
P. Lacome, published in Paris.</p>

<p>The jota is another dance in 3-4 time. Every
province in Spain has its own jota, but the most
famous variations are those of Aragon, Valencia,
and Navarre. It is accompanied by the guitar,
the <i>bandarria</i> (similar to the guitar), small drum,
castanets, and triangle. Mr. Hale says that its
origin in the twelfth century is attributed to a
Moor named Alben Jot who fled from Valencia to
Aragon. “The jota,” he continues, “is danced
not only at merrymakings but at certain religious
festivals and even in watching the dead. One
called the ‘Natividad del Señor’ (nativity of our
Lord) is danced on Christmas eve in Aragon, and
is accompanied by songs, and jotas are sung and
danced at the crossroads, invoking the favour of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>the Virgin, when the festival of Our Lady del Pilar
is celebrated at Saragossa.”</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis’s description of the jota is worth
reproducing: “The Aragonaise jota, the most
important and typical dance outside Andalusia, is
danced by a man and a woman, and is a kind of
combat between them; most of the time they are
facing each other, both using castanets and advancing
and retreating in an apparently aggressive
manner, the arms alternately slightly raised
and lowered, and the legs, with a seeming attempt
to trip the partner, kicking out alternately somewhat
sidewise, as the body is rapidly supported
first on one side and then on the other. It is a
monotonous dance, with immense rapidity and vivacity
in its monotony, but it has not the deliberate
grace and fascination, the happy audacities
of Andalusian dancing. There is, indeed, no
faintest suggestion of voluptuousness in it, but it
may rather be said, in the words of a modern poet,
Salvador Rueda, to have in it ‘the sound of helmets
and plumes and lances and banners, the roaring
of cannon, the neighing of horses, the shock of
swords.’”</p>

<p>Chabrier, in his astounding and amusing letters
from Spain, gives us vivid pictures and interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>information. This one, written to his friend,
Edouard Moullé, from Granada, November 4,
1882, appeared in “S. I. M.” April 15, 1911 (I
have omitted the musical illustrations, which, however,
possess great value for the student): “In a
month I must leave adorable Spain ... and say
good-bye to the Spaniards,—because, I say this
only to you, they are very nice, the little girls! I
have not seen a really ugly woman since I have
been in Andalusia: I do not speak of the feet, they
are so small that I have never seen them; the hands
are tiny and well-kept and the arms of an exquisite
contour; I speak only of what one can see,
but they show a good deal; add the arabesques, the
side-curls, and other ingenuities of the coiffure,
the inevitable fan, the flower and the comb in the
hair, placed well behind, the shawl of Chinese
crêpe, with long fringe and embroidered in flowers,
knotted around the figure, the arm bare, and the
eye protected by eyelashes which are long enough
to curl; the skin of dull white or orange colour,
according to the race, all this smiling, gesticulating,
dancing, drinking, and careless to the last degree....</p>

<p>“That is the Andalusian.</p>

<p>“Every evening we go with Alice to the café-concerts
where the malagueñas, the Soledas, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>Sapateados, and the Peteneras are sung; then the
dances, absolutely Arab, to speak truth; if you
could see them wriggle, unjoint their hips, contortion,
I believe you would not try to get away!...
At Malaga the dancing became so intense that I
was compelled to take my wife away; it wasn’t even
amusing any more. I can’t write about it, but I
remember it and I will describe it to you.—I have
no need to tell you that I have noted down many
things; the tango, a kind of dance in which the
women imitate the pitching of a ship (<i>le tangage
du navire</i>) is the only dance in 2 time; all the others,
all, are in 3-4 (Seville) or in 3-8 (Malaga and
Cadiz);—in the North it is different, there is
some music in 5-8, very curious. The 2-4 of the
tango is always like the habanera; this is the picture:
one or two women dance, two silly men play
it doesn’t matter what on their guitars, and five
or six women howl, with excruciating voices and in
triplet figures impossible to note down because
they change the air—every instant a new scrap
of tune. They howl a series of figurations with
syllables, words, rising voices, clapping hands
which strike the six quavers, emphasizing the third
and the sixth, cries of Anda! Anda! La Salud!
eso es la Maraquita! gracia, nationidad! Baila,
la chiquilla! Anda! Anda! Consuelo! Olè, la
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>Lola, olè la Carmen! que gracia! que elegancia! all
that to excite the young dancer. It is vertiginous—it
is unspeakable!</p>

<p>“The Sevillana is another thing: it is in 3-4
time (and with castanets).... All this becomes
extraordinarily alluring with two curls, a pair of
castanets and a guitar. It is impossible to write
down the malagueña. It is a melopœia, however,
which has a form and which always ends on the
dominant, to which the guitar furnishes 3-8 time,
and the spectator (when there is one) seated beside
the guitarist, holds a cane between his legs
and beats the syncopated rhythm; the dancers
themselves instinctively syncopate the measures in
a thousand ways, striking with their heels an unbelievable
number of rhythms.... It is all
rhythm and dance: the airs scraped out by the
guitarist have no value; besides, they cannot be
heard on account of the cries of Anda! la chiquilla!
que gracia! que elegancia! Anda! Olè!
Olè! la chiquirritita! and the more the cries the
more the dancer laughs with her mouth wide open,
and turns her hips, and is mad with her
body....”</p>

<p>As it is on these dances that composers invariably
base their Spanish music (not alone Albeniz,
Chapí, Bretón, and Granados, but Chabrier,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>Ravel, Laparra, and Bizet, as well) we may linger
somewhat longer on their delights. The following
compelling description is from Richard Ford’s
highly readable “Gatherings from Spain”:
“The dance which is closely analogous to the
<i>Ghowasee</i> of the Egyptians, and the <i>Nautch</i> of
the Hindoos, is called the <i>Olè</i> by Spaniards, the
<i>Romalis</i> by their gipsies; the soul and essence of
it consists in the expression of a certain sentiment,
one not indeed of a very sentimental or correct
character. The ladies, who seem to have no
bones, resolve the problem of perpetual motion,
their feet having comparatively a sinecure, as the
whole person performs a pantomime, and trembles
like an aspen leaf; the flexible form and Terpsichore
figure of a young Andalusian girl—be
she gipsy or not—is said, by the learned, to
have been designed by nature as the fit frame for
her voluptuous imagination.</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, the scholar and classical
commentator will every moment quote Martial,
etc., when he beholds the unchanged balancing of
hands, raised as if to catch showers of roses, the
tapping of the feet, and the serpentine quivering
movements. A contagious excitement seizes the
spectators, who, like Orientals, beat time with
their hands in measured cadence, and at every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>pause applaud with cries and clappings. The
damsels, thus encouraged, continue in violent
action until nature is all but exhausted; then
aniseed brandy, wine, and <i>alpisteras</i> are handed
about, and the fête, carried on to early dawn,
often concludes in broken heads, which here are
called ‘gipsy’s fare.’ These dances appear, to a
stranger from the chilly north, to be more marked
by energy than by grace, nor have the legs less
to do than the body, hips, and arms. The sight
of this unchanged pastime of antiquity, which excites
the Spaniard to frenzy, rather disgusts an
English spectator, possibly from some national
malorganization, for, as Molière says, ‘l’Angleterre
a produit des grands hommes dans les
sciences et les beaux arts, mais pas un grand
danseur—allez lire l’histoire.’” (A fact as true
in our day as it was in Molière’s.)</p>

<p>On certain days the sevillana is danced before
the high altar of the cathedral at Seville. The
Reverend Henry Cart de Lafontaine (“Proceedings
of the Musical Association”; London, thirty-third
session, 1906-7) gives the following account
of it, quoting a “French author”: “While
Louis XIII was reigning over France, the Pope
heard much talk of the Spanish dance called the
‘Sevillana.’ He wished to satisfy himself, by actual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>eye-witness, as to the character of this dance,
and expressed his wish to a bishop of the diocese of
Seville, who every year visited Rome. Evil
tongues make the bishop responsible for the primary
suggestion of the idea. Be that as it may,
the bishop, on his return to Seville, had twelve
youths well instructed in all the intricate measures
of this Andalusian dance. He had to choose
youths, for how could he present maidens to the
horrified glance of the Holy Father? When his
little troop was thoroughly schooled and perfected,
he took the party to Rome, and the audience
was arranged. The ‘Sevillana’ was danced
in one of the rooms of the Vatican. The Pope
warmly complimented the young executants, who
were dressed in beautiful silk costumes of the
period. The bishop humbly asked for permission
to perform this dance at certain fêtes in the
cathedral church at Seville, and further pleaded
for a restriction of this privilege to that church
alone. The Pope, hoist by his own petard, did
not like to refuse, but granted the privilege with
this restriction, that it should only last so long as
the costumes of the dancers were wearable. Needless
to say, these costumes are, therefore, objects
of constant repair, but they are supposed to
retain their identity even to this day. And this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>is the reason why the twelve boys who dance the
‘Sevillana’ before the high altar in the cathedral
on certain feast days are dressed in the costume
belonging to the reign of Louis XIII.”</p>

<p>This is a very pretty story, but it is not uncontradicted....
Has any statement been made
about Spanish dancing or music which has been
allowed to go uncontradicted? Look upon that
picture and upon this: “As far as it is possible
to ascertain from records,” says Rhoda G. Edwards
in the “Musical Standard,” “this dance
would seem always to have been in use in Seville
cathedral; when the town was taken from the
Moors in the thirteenth century it was undoubtedly
an established custom and in 1428 we find the six
boys recognized as an integral part of the chapter
by Pope Eugenius IV. The dance is known as
the (<i>sic</i>) ‘Los Scises,’ or dance of the six boys
who, with four others, dance it before the high
altar at Benediction on the three evenings before
Lent and in the octaves of Corpus Christi and La
Purissima (the conception of Our Lady). The
dress of the boys is most picturesque, page costumes
of the time of Philip III being worn, blue
for La Purissima and red satin doublets slashed
with blue for the other occasion; white hats with
blue and white feathers are also worn whilst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>dancing. The dance is usually of twenty-five
minutes’ duration and in form seems quite unique,
not resembling any of the other Spanish dance-forms,
or in fact those of any other country.
The boys accompany the symphony on castanets
and sing a hymn in two parts whilst dancing.”</p>

<p>From another author we learn that religious
dancing is to be seen elsewhere in Spain than at
Seville cathedral. At one time, it is said to have
been common. The pilgrims to the shrine of the
Virgin at Montserrat were wont to dance, and
dancing took place in the churches of Valencia,
Toledo, and Jurez. Religious dancing continued
to be common, especially in Catalonia up to the
seventeenth century. An account of the dance
in the Seville cathedral may be found in “Los
Españoles Pintados por si Mismos” (pages
287-91).</p>

<p>This very incomplete and rambling record of
Spanish dancing should include some mention of
the fandango. The origin of the word is obscure,
but the dance is obviously one of the gayest
and wildest of the Spanish dances. Like the
malagueña it is in 3-8 time, but it is quite different
in spirit from that sensuous form of terpsichorean
enjoyment. La Argentina informs me
that “fandango” in Spanish suggests very much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>what “bachanale” does in English or French.
It is a very old dance, and may be a survival of
a Moorish dance, as Desrat suggests. Mr. Philip
Hale found the following account of it somewhere:</p>

<p>“Like an electric shock, the notes of the
fandango animate all hearts. Men and women,
young and old, acknowledge the power of this air
over the ears and soul of every Spaniard. The
young men spring to their places, rattling castanets,
or imitating their sound by snapping their
fingers. The girls are remarkable for the willowy
languor and lightness of their movements,
the voluptuousness of their attitudes—beating
the exactest time with tapping heels. Partners
tease and entreat and pursue each other by turns.
Suddenly the music stops, and each dancer shows
his skill by remaining absolutely motionless,
bounding again in the full life of the fandango as
the orchestra strikes up. The sound of the guitar,
the violin, the rapid tic-tac of heels
(<i>taconeos</i>), the crack of fingers and castanets,
the supple swaying of the dancers, fill the spectators
with ecstasy.</p>

<p>“The music whirls along in a rapid triple time.
Spangles glitter; the sharp clank of ivory and
ebony castanets beats out the cadence of strange,
throbbing, deafening notes—assonances unknown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>to music, but curiously characteristic,
effective, and intoxicating. Amidst the rustle of
silks, smiles gleam over white teeth, dark eyes
sparkle and droop, and flash up again in flame.
All is flutter and glitter, grace and animation—quivering,
sonorous, passionate, seductive. <i>Olè!
Olè!</i> Faces beam and burn. <i>Olè! Olè!</i></p>

<p>“The bolero intoxicates, the fandango inflames.”</p>

<p>It can be well understood that the study of
Spanish dancing and its music must be carried on
in Spain. Mr. Ellis tells us why: “Another
characteristic of Spanish dancing, and especially
of the most typical kind called flamenco, lies in its
accompaniments, and particularly in the fact that
under proper conditions all the spectators are
themselves performers.... Thus it is that at
the end of a dance an absolute silence often falls,
with no sound of applause: the relation of performers
and public has ceased to exist.... The
finest Spanish dancing is at once killed or degraded
by the presence of an indifferent or unsympathetic
public, and that is probably why it cannot be
transplanted, but remains local.”</p>

<p>At the end of a dance an absolute silence often
falls.... I am again in an underground café
in Amsterdam. It is the eve of the Queen’s birthday,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>and the Dutch are celebrating. The low,
smoke-wreathed room is crowded with students,
soldiers, and women. Now a weazened female
takes her place at the piano, on a slightly raised
platform at one side of the room. She begins to
play. The dancing begins. It is not woman with
man; the dancing is informal. Some dance together,
and some dance alone; some sing the
melody of the tune, others shriek, but all make a
noise. Faster and faster and louder and louder
the music is pounded out, and the dancing becomes
wilder and wilder. A tray of glasses is kicked
from the upturned palm of a sweaty waiter.
Waiter, broken glass, dancer, all lie, a laughing
heap, on the floor. A soldier and a woman stand
in opposite corners, facing the corners; then without
turning, they back towards the middle of the
room at a furious pace; the collision is appalling.
Hand in hand the mad dancers encircle the room,
throwing confetti, beer, anything. A heavy stein
crushes two teeth—the wound bleeds—but the
dancer does not stop. Noise and action and
colour all become synonymous. There is no
escape from the force. I am dragged into the
circle. Suddenly the music stops. All the
dancers stop. The soldier no longer looks at the
woman by his side; not a word is spoken. People
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>lumber towards chairs. The woman looks for a
glass of water to assuage the pain of her bleeding
mouth. I think Jaques-Dalcroze is right when
he seeks to unite spectator and actor, drama and
public.</p>


<p class="ph3">IV</p>

<p>In the preceding section I may have too
strongly insisted upon the relation of the folk-song
to the dance. It is true that the two are
seldom separated in performance (although not
all songs are danced; for example, the <i>cañas</i> and
<i>playeras</i> of Andalusia). However, most of the
folk-songs of Spain are intended to be danced;
they are built on dance rhythms and they bear
the names of dances. Thus the jota is always
danced to the same music, although the variations
are great at different times and in different
provinces. It is, of course, when the folk-songs
are danced that they make their best effect, in the
polyrhythm achieved by the opposing rhythms of
guitar-player, dancer, and singer. When there is
no dancer the defect is sometimes overcome by
some one tapping a stick on the ground in imitation
of resounding heels.</p>

<p>Blind beggars have a habit of singing the songs,
in certain provinces, with a wealth of florid ornament,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>such ornament as is always associated with
oriental airs in performance, and this ornament
still plays a considerable rôle when the vocalist
becomes an integral part of the accompaniment
for a dancer. Chabrier gives several examples of
it in one of his letters. In the circumstances it
can readily be seen that Spanish folk-songs written
down are pretty bare recollections of the real
thing, and when sung by singers who have no
knowledge of the traditional manner of performing
them they are likely to sound fairly banal.
The same thing might be said of the negro folk-songs
of America, or the folk-songs of Russia or
Hungary, but with much less truth, for the folk-songs
of these countries usually possess a melodic
interest which is seldom inherent in the folk-songs
of Spain. To make their effect they must be
performed by Spaniards, as nearly as possible
after the manner of the people. Indeed, their
spirit and their polyrhythmic effects are much
more essential to their proper interpretation than
their melody, as many witnesses have pointed out.</p>

<p>Spanish music, indeed, much of it, is actually
unpleasant to Western ears; it lacks the sad
monotony and the wailing intensity of true oriental
music; much of it is loud and blaring, like the
hot sunglare of the Iberian peninsula. However,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>many a Western or Northern European has found
pleasure in listening by the hour to the strains,
which often sound as if they were improvised, sung
by some beggar or mountaineer.</p>

<p>The collections of these songs are not in any
sense complete and few of them attempt more than
a collocation of the songs of one locality or people.
Deductions have been drawn. For example it is
noted that the Basque songs are irregular in
melody and rhythm and are further marked by
unusual tempos, 5-8, or 7-4. In Aragon and
Navarre the popular song (and dance) is the
jota; in Galicia, the seguidilla; the Catalonian
songs resemble the folk-tunes of Southern France.
The Andalusian songs, like the dances of that
province, are the most beautiful of all, often truly
oriental in their rhythm and floridity. In Spain
the gipsy has become an integral part of the
popular life, and it is difficult at times to determine
what is <i>flamenco</i> and what is Spanish. However,
collections (few to be sure) have been attempted
of gipsy songs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this rambling article I have
touched on the <i>villancicos</i> and the early song-writers.
To do justice to these subjects would
require a good deal more space and a different
intention. Those who are interested in them may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>pursue these matters in Pedrell’s various works.
The most available collection of Spanish folk-tunes
is that issued by P. Lacome and J. Puig y
Alsubide (Paris, 1872). There are several collections
of Basque songs; Demofilo’s “Coleccion
de Cantos Flamencos” (Seville, 1881), Cecilio
Ocon’s collection of Andalusian folk-songs, and
F. Rodriguez Marin’s “Cantos Populares Españoles”
(Seville, 1882-3) may also be mentioned.</p>


<p class="ph3">V</p>

<p>After the bullfight the most popular form of
amusement in Spain is the zarzuela, the only
distinctive art-form which Spanish music has
evolved, but there has been no progress; the form
has not changed, except perhaps to degenerate,
since its invention in the early seventeenth century.
Soriano Fuertes and other writers have
devoted pages to grieving because Spanish composers
have not taken occasion to make something
grander and more important out of the zarzuela.
The fact remains that they have not, although,
small and great alike, they have all taken a hand
at writing these entertainments. But as they
found the zarzuela, so they have left it. It must
be conceded that the form is quite distinct from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>that of opera and should not be confused with it.
And the Spaniards are probably right when they
assert that the zarzuela is the mother of the
French opéra-bouffe. At least it must be admitted
that Offenbach and Lecocq and their precursors
owe something of the germ of their inspiration
to the Spanish form. To-day the melody
chests of the zarzuela markets are plundered
to find tunes for French <i>revues</i>, and such popular
airs as <i>La Paraguaya</i> and <i>Y ... Como le Vá?</i>
were originally danced and sung in Spanish theatres.
The composer of these airs, J. Valverde
<i>fils</i>, indeed found the French market so good that
he migrated to Paris, and for some time has been
writing <i>musique mélangée ... une moitié de
chaque nation</i>. So <i>La Rose de Grenade</i>, composed
for Paris, might have been written for
Spain, with slight melodic alterations and tauromachian
allusions in the book.</p>

<p>The zarzuela is usually a one act piece
(although sometimes it is permitted to run into
two or more acts) in which the music is freely
interrupted by spoken dialogue, and that in turn
gives way to national dances. Very often the
entire score is danced as well as sung. The subject
is usually comic and often topical, although
it may be serious, poetic, or even tragic. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>actors often introduce dialogue of their own,
“gagging” freely; sometimes they engage in long
impromptu conversations with members of the
audience. They also embroider on the music after
the fashion of the great singers of the old Italian
opera (Dr. de Lafontaine asserts that Spanish
audiences, even in cabarets, demand embroidery
of this sort). The music is spirited and lively,
and in the dances, Andalusian, <i>flamenco</i>, or Sevillan,
as the case may be, it attains its best results.
H. V. Hamilton, in his essay on the subject
in Grove’s Dictionary, says, “The music is
... apt to be vague in form when the national
dance and folk-song forms are avoided. The
orchestration is a little blatant.” It will be seen
that this description suits Granados’s <i>Goyescas</i>
(the opera), which is on its safest ground during
the dances and becomes excessively vague at other
times; but <i>Goyescas</i> is not a zarzuela, because
there is no spoken dialogue. Otherwise it bears
the earmarks. A zarzuela stands somewhere between
a French <i>revue</i> and opéra-comique. It is
usually, however, more informal in tone than the
latter and often decidedly more serious than the
former. All the musicians in Spain since the form
was invented (excepting, of course, certain exclusively
religious composers), and most of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>poets and playwrights, have contributed numerous
examples. Thus Calderon wrote the first zarzuela,
and Lope de Vega contributed words to entertainments
much in the same order. In our day
Spain’s leading dramatist, Echegaray (died 1916),
has written one of the most popular zarzuelas,
<i>Gigantes y Cabezudos</i> (the music by Caballero).
The subject is the fiesta of Santa Maria del Pilar.
It has had many a long run and is often revived.
Another very popular zarzuela, which was almost,
if not quite, heard in New York, is <i>La Gran Via</i>
(by Valverde, <i>père</i>), which has been performed in
London in extended form. The principal theatres
for the zarzuela in Madrid are (or were until recently)
that of the Calle de Jovellanos, called the
Teatro de Zarzuela, and the Apolo. Usually
four separate zarzuelas are performed in one evening
before as many audiences.</p>

<p><i>La Gran Via</i>, which in some respects may be
considered a typical zarzuela, consists of a string
of dance tunes, with no more homogeneity than
their national significance would suggest. There
is an introduction and polka, a waltz, a tango, a
jota, a mazurka, a schottische, another waltz, and
a two-step (<i>paso-doble</i>). The tunes have little
distinction; nor can the orchestration be considered
brilliant. There is a great deal of noise and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>variety of rhythm, and when presented correctly
the effect must be precisely that of one of the
dance-halls described by Chabrier. The zarzuela,
to be enjoyed, in fact, must be seen in Spain.
Like Spanish dancing it requires a special audience
to bring out its best points. There must be
a certain electricity, at least an element of sympathy,
to carry the thing through successfully.
Examination of the scores of zarzuelas (many of
them have been printed and some of them are to
be seen in our libraries) will convince any one that
Mr. Ellis is speaking mildly when he says that
the Spaniards love noise. However, the combination
of this noise with beautiful women, dancing,
elaborate rhythm, and a shouting audience, seems
to almost equal the café-concert dancing and the
tauromachian spectacles in Spanish popular affection.
(Of course, as I have suggested, there
are zarzuelas more serious melodically and dramatically;
but as <i>La Gran Via</i> is frequently mentioned
by writers as one of the most popular
examples, it may be selected as typical of the
larger number of these entertainments.)</p>

<p>H. V. Hamilton says that the first performance
of a zarzuela took place in 1628 (Pedrell gives
the date as October 29, 1629), during the reign
of Felipe IV, in the Palace of the Zarzuela (so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
because it was surrounded by <i>zarzas</i>,
brambles). It was called <i>El Jardin de Falerina</i>;
the text was by the great Calderon and the music
by Juan Risco, chapelmaster of the cathedral at
Cordova, according to Mr. Hamilton, who doubtless
follows Soriano Fuertes on this detail.
Soubies, following the more modern studies of
Pedrell, gives Jose Peyró the credit. Pedrell, in
his richly documented work, “Teatro Lírico Española
anterior al siglo XIX,” attributes the
music of this zarzuela to Peyró and gives an example
of it. The first Spanish opera dates from
the same period, Lope de Vega’s <i>La Selva sin
Amor</i> (1629). As a matter of fact, many of the
plays of Calderon and Lope de Vega were performed
with music to heighten the effect of the
declamation, and musical curtain-raisers and
interludes were performed before and in the midst
of all of them. Lana, Palomares, Benavente and
Hidalgo were among the musicians who contributed
music to the theatre of this period. Hidalgo
wrote the music for Calderon’s zarzuela,
<i>Ni Amor se Libre de Amor</i>. To the same group
belong Miguel Ferrer, Juan de Navas, Sebastien
de Navas, and Jéronimo de la Torre. (Examples
of the music of these men may be found in the
aforementioned “Teatro Lírico.”) Until 1659
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>zarzuelas were written by the best poets and composers
and frequently performed on royal birthdays,
at royal marriages, and on many other
occasions; but after that date the art fell into a
decline and seems to have been in eclipse during
the whole of the eighteenth century. According
to Soriano Fuertes the beginning of the reign of
Felipe V marked the introduction of Italian opera
into Spain (more popular than Spanish opera
there to this day) and the decadence of nationalism
(whole pages of Fuertes read very much like
the plaints of modern English composers about
the neglect of national composers in their country).
In 1829 there was a revival of interest in
Spanish music and a conservatory was founded
in Madrid. (For a discussion of this later period
the reader is referred to “La Opera Española en
el Siglo XIX,” by Antonio Peña y Goñi, 1881.)
This interest has been fostered by Fuertes and
Pedrell, and the younger composers to-day are
taking some account of it. There is hope, indeed,
that Spanish music may again take its place in
the world of art.</p>

<p>Of course, the zarzuela did not spring into being
out of nowhere and nothing, and the true origins
are not entirely obscure. It is generally agreed
that a priest, Juan del Encina (born at Salamanca,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>1468), was the true founder of the secular
theatre in Spain. His dramatic compositions are
in the nature of eclogues based on Virgilian
models. In all of these there is singing and in
one a dance. Isabel la Católica in the fifteenth
century always had at her command a troop of
musicians and poets who comforted and consoled
her in her chapel with motets and <i>plegarias</i>
(French, <i>prière</i>), and in the royal apartments
with <i>canciones</i> and <i>villancicos</i>. (<i>Canciones</i> are
songs inclining towards the ballad-form. <i>Villancicos</i>
are songs in the old Spanish measure; they
receive their name from their rustic character, as
supposedly they were first composed by the
<i>villanos</i> or peasants for the nativity and other
festivals of the church.) “It is necessary to
search for the true origins of the Spanish musical
spectacle,” states Soubies, “in the <i>villancicos</i> and
<i>cantacillos</i> which alternated with the dialogue in
the works of Juan del Encina and Lucas Fernandez,
without forgetting the <i>ensaladas</i>, the <i>jacaras</i>,
etc., which served as intermezzi and curtain-raisers.”
These were sung before the curtain, before
the drama was performed (and during the
intervals, with jokes added) by women in court
dress, and later created a form of their own (besides
contributing to the creation of the zarzuela),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>the <i>tonadilla</i>, which, accompanied by a
guitar or violin and interspersed with dances, was
very popular for a number of years. H. V. Hamilton
is probably on sound ground when he says,
“That the first zarzuela was written with an express
desire for expansion and development is,
however, not so certain as that it was the result
of a wish to inaugurate the new house of entertainment
with something entirely original and
novel.”</p>


<p class="ph3">VI</p>

<p>We have Richard Ford’s testimony that Spain
was not very musical in his day. The Reverend
Henry Cart de Lafontaine says that the contemporary
musical services in the churches are not
to be considered seriously from an artistic point
of view. Emmanuel Chabrier was impressed with
the fact that the music for dancing was almost
entirely rhythmic in its effect, strummed rudely
on the guitar, the spectators meanwhile making
such a din that it was practically impossible to
distinguish a melody, had there been one. And
all observers point at the Italian opera, which is
still the favourite opera in Spain (in Barcelona at
the Liceo three weeks of opera in Catalon is given
after the regular season in Italian; in Madrid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>at the Teatro Real the Spanish season is scattered
through the Italian), and at Señor Arbós’s concerts
(the same Señor Arbós who was once concert
master of the Boston Symphony Orchestra), at
which Brandenburg concertos and Beethoven symphonies
are more frequently performed than works
by Albeniz. Still there are, and have always
been during the course of the last century, Spanish
composers, some of whom have made a little
noise in the outer world, although a good many
have been content to spend their artistic energy
on the manufacture of zarzuelas—in other
words, to make a good deal of noise in Spain. In
most modern instances, however, there has been
a revival of interest in the national forms, and
folk-song and folk-dance have contributed their
important share to the composers’ work. No one
man has done more to encourage this interest in
nationalism than Felipe Pedrell, who may be said
to have begun in Spain the work which the “Five”
accomplished in Russia. Pedrell says in his
“Handbook” (Barcelona, 1891; Heinrich and
Co.; French translation by Bertal; Paris, Fischbacher):
“The popular song, the voice of the
people, the pure primitive inspiration of the
anonymous singer, passes through the alembic of
contemporary art and one obtains thereby its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>quintessence; the composer assimilates it and then
reveals it in the most delicate form that music
alone is capable of rendering form in its technical
aspect, this thanks to the extraordinary development
of the technique of our art in this epoch.
The folk-song lends the accent, the background,
and modern art lends all that it possesses, its conventional
symbolism and the richness of form
which is its patrimony. The frame is enlarged
in such a fashion that the <i>lied</i> makes a corresponding
development; could it be said then that the
national lyric drama is the same <i>lied</i> expanded?
Is not the national lyric drama the product of the
force of absorption and creative power? Do we
not see in it faithfully reflected not only the artistic
idiosyncrasy of each composer, but all the
artistic manifestations of the people?” There
is always the search for new composers in Spain
and always the hope that a man may come who
will be acclaimed by the world. As a consequence,
the younger composers in Spain often receive
more adulation than is their due. It must be remembered
that the most successful Spanish music
is not serious, the Spanish are more themselves
in the lighter vein.</p>

<p>I hesitate for a moment on the name of Martin
y Solar, born at Valencia; died at St. Petersburg,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>1806; called “The Italian” by the Spaniards on
account of his musical style, and “lo Spagnuolo”
by the Italians. Da Ponte wrote several opera-books
for him, <i>l’Arbore di Diana</i>, <i>la Cosa Rara</i>,
and <i>La Capricciosa Corretta</i> (a version of <i>The
Taming of the Shrew</i>) among others. It is to
be seen that he is without importance if considered
as a composer distinctively Spanish and I have
made this slight reference to him solely to recount
how Mozart quoted an air from one of his operas
in the supper scene of <i>Don Giovanni</i>. At the time
Martin y Solar was better liked in Vienna than
Mozart himself and the air in question was as
well-known as say Musetta’s waltz is known to us.</p>

<p>Juan Chrysostomo Arriaga, born in Bilbao
1808; died 1828 (these dates are given in Grove:
1806-1826), is another matter. He might have
become better known had he lived longer. As it
is, some of his music has been performed in London
and Paris, and perhaps in America, although I
have no record of it. He studied in Paris at the
Conservatoire, under Fétis for harmony, and
Baillot for violin. Before he went to Paris even,
as a child, with no knowledge of the rules of harmony,
he had written an opera! Cherubini declared
his fugue for eight voices on the words in
the Credo, “Et Vitam Venturi” a veritable chef
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>d’œuvre, at least there is a legend to this effect.
In 1824 he wrote three quartets, an overture, a
symphony, a mass, and some French cantatas and
romances. Garcia considered his opera <i>Los
Esclavas Felices</i> so good that he attempted, unsuccessfully,
to secure for it a Paris hearing. It
has been performed in Bilbao, which city, I think,
celebrated the centenary of the composer’s birth.</p>

<p>Manuel Garcia is better known to us as a
singer, an impresario, and a father, than as a
composer! Still he wrote a good deal of music
(so did Mme. Malibran; for a list of the diva’s
compositions I must refer the reader to Arthur
Pougin’s biography). Fétis enumerates seventeen
Spanish, nineteen Italian, and seven French
operas by Garcia. He had works produced in
Madrid, at the Opéra in Paris (<i>La mort du Tasse</i>
and <i>Florestan</i>), at the Italiens in Paris (<i>Fazzoletto</i>),
at the Opéra-Comique in Paris (<i>Deux
Contrats</i>), and at many other theatres. However,
when all is said and done, Manuel Garcia’s
reputation still rests on his singing and his daughters.
His compositions are forgotten; nor was
his music, much of it, probably, truly Spanish.
(However, I have heard a polo [serenade] from
an opera called <i>El Poeta Calculista</i>, which is so
Spanish in accent and harmony—and so beautiful—that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>it has found a place in a collection
of folk-tunes!)</p>

<p>Miguel Hilarion Eslava (born in Burlada, October
21, 1807, died at Madrid, July 23, 1878)
is chiefly famous for his compilation, the “Lira
Sacra-Hispana,” mentioned heretofore. He also
composed over 140 pieces of church music, masses,
motets, songs, etc., after he had been appointed
chapelmaster of Queen Isabella in 1844, and several
operas, including <i>Il Solitario</i>, <i>La Tregua di
Ptolemaide</i>, and <i>Pedro el Cruél</i>. He also wrote
several books of theory and composition: “Método
de Solfeo” (1846) and “Escuela de
Armonía y Composición” in three parts (harmony,
composition, and melody). He edited
(1855-6) the “Gaceta Músical de Madrid.”</p>

<p>There is the celebrated virtuoso, Pablo de Sarasate,
who wrote music, but his memory is perhaps
better preserved in Whistler’s diabolical portrait
than in his own compositions.</p>

<p>Felipe Pedrell (born February 19, 1841) is
also perhaps more important as a writer on musical
subjects and for his influence on the younger
school of composers (he teaches in the conservatory
of Barcelona, and his attitude towards
nationalism has already been discussed), than he
is as a composer. Still, Edouard Lopez-Chavarri
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>does not hesitate to pronounce his trilogy <i>Los
Pireneos</i> (Barcelona, 1902; the prologue was performed
in Venice in 1897) the most important
work for the theatre written in Spain. His first
opera, <i>El Último Abencerrajo</i>, was produced in
Barcelona in 1874. Some of his other works are
<i>Quasimodo</i>, 1875; <i>El Tasso a Ferrara</i>, <i>Cleopatra</i>,
<i>Mazeppa</i> (Madrid, 1881), <i>Celestine</i> (1904), and
<i>La Matinada</i> (1905). J. A. Fuller-Maitland
says that the influence of Wagner is traceable in
all his stage work. (Wagner is adored in Spain;
<i>Parsifal</i> was given eighteen times in one month at
the Liceo in Barcelona.) If this be true, his case
will be found to bear other resemblances to that
of the Russian “Five,” who found it difficult to
exorcise all foreign influences in their pursuit of
nationalism.</p>

<p>He was made a member of the Spanish Academy
in 1894 and shortly thereafter became Professor
of Musical History and Æsthetics at the Royal
Conservatory at Madrid. Besides his “Hispaniae
Schola Musica Sacra” he has written a
number of other books, and translated Richter’s
treatise on Harmony into Spanish. He has made
several excursions into the history of folk-lore
and the principal results are contained in “Músicos
Anónimos” and “Por nuestra Música.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>Other works are “Teatro Lírico Español anterior
al siglo XIX,” “Lírica Nacionalizada,” “De
Música Religiosa,” “Músiquerias y mas Músiquesias.”
One of his books, “Músicos Contemporáneos
y de Otros Tempos” (in the library of
the Hispanic Society of New York) is very catholic
in its range of subject. It includes essays on
the <i>Don Quixote</i> of Strauss, the <i>Boris Godunow</i>
of Moussorgsky, Smetana, Manuel Garcia, Edward
Elgar, Jaques-Dalcroze, Bruckner, Mahler,
Albeniz, Palestrina, Busoni, and the tenth symphony
of Beethoven!</p>

<p>In John Towers’s extraordinary compilation,
“Dictionary-Catalogue of Operas,” it is stated
that Manuel Fernandez Caballero (born in 1835)
wrote sixty-two operas, and the names of them
are given. He was a pupil of Fuertes (harmony)
and Eslava (composition) at the Madrid Conservatory
and later became very popular as a
writer of zarzuelas. I have already mentioned his
<i>Gigantes y Cabezudos</i> for which Echegaray furnished
the libretto. Among his other works in
this form are <i>Los Dineros del Sacristan</i>, <i>Los
Africanistas</i> (Barcelona, 1894), <i>El Cabo Primero</i>
(Barcelona, 1895), and <i>La Rueda de la Fortuna</i>
(Madrid, 1896).</p>

<p>At a concert given in the New York Hippodrome,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>April 3, 1911, Mme. Tetrazzini sang a
Spanish song, which was referred to the next day
by the reviewers of the “New York Times” and
the “New York Globe.” To say truth the soprano
made a great effect with the song, although
it was written for a low voice. It was <i>Carceleras</i>,
from Ruperto Chapí’s zarzuela <i>Hija del
Zebedeo</i>. Chapí was one of the most prolific and
popular composers of Spain during the last century.
He produced countless zarzuelas and nine
children. He was born at Villena March 27,
1851, and he died March 25, 1909, a few months
earlier than his compatriot Isaac Albeniz. He
was admitted to the conservatory of Madrid in
1867 as a pupil of piano and harmony. In 1869
he obtained the first prize for harmony and he continued
to obtain prizes until in 1874 he was sent
to Rome by the Academy of Fine Arts. He remained
for some time in Italy and Paris. In
1875 the Teatro Real of Madrid played his <i>La
Hija de Jefté</i> sent from Rome. The following is
an incomplete list of his operas and zarzuelas:
<i>Via Libra</i>, <i>Los Gendarmes</i>, <i>El Rey que Rabio</i> (3
acts), <i>La Verbena de la Paloma</i>, <i>El Reclamo</i>, <i>La
Tempestad</i>, <i>La Bruja</i>, <i>La Leyenda del Monje</i>, <i>Las
Campanados</i>, <i>La Czarina</i>, <i>El Milagro de la Virgen</i>,
<i>Roger de Flor</i> (3 acts), <i>Las Naves de Cortes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>Circe</i> (3 acts), <i>A qui Base Farsa un Hombre</i>,
<i>Juan Francisco</i> (3 acts, 1905; rewritten and presented
in 1908 as <i>Entre Rocas</i>), <i>Los Madrileños</i>
(1908), <i>La Dama Roja</i> (1 act, 1908), <i>Hesperia</i>
(1908), <i>Las Calderas de Pedro Bolero</i> (1909)
and <i>Margarita la Tornera</i>, presented just before
his death without success.</p>

<p>His other works include an oratorio, <i>Los
Angeles</i>, a symphonic poem, <i>Escenas de Capa y
Espada</i>, a symphony in D, <i>Moorish Fantasy</i> for
orchestra, a serenade for orchestra, a trio for
piano, violin and ’cello, songs, etc. Chapí was
president of the Society of Authors and Composers,
and when he died the King and Queen of
Spain sent a telegram of condolence to his widow.
There is a copy of his zarzuela, <i>Blasones y Talegas</i>
in the New York Public Library.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of <i>Dolores</i>. It is one of
a long series of operas and zarzuelas written by
Tomás Bretón y Hernandez (born at Salamanca,
December 29, 1850). First produced at Madrid,
in 1895, it has been sung with success in such distant
capitals as Buenos Ayres and Prague. I
have been assured by a Spanish woman of impeccable
taste that <i>Dolores</i> is charming, delightful
in its fluent melody and its striking rhythms, thoroughly
Spanish in style, but certain to find favour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>in America, if it were produced here. Our own
Eleanora de Cisneros at a Press Club Benefit in
Barcelona appeared in Bretón’s zarzuela <i>La Verbena
de la Paloma</i>. Another of Bretón’s famous
zarzuelas is <i>Los Amantes de Ternel</i> (Madrid,
1889). His works for the theatre further include
<i>Tabaré</i>, for which he wrote both words and music
(Madrid, 1913); <i>Don Gil</i> (Barcelona, 1914);
<i>Garin</i> (Barcelona, 1891); <i>Raquel</i> (Madrid,
1900); <i>Guzman el Bueno</i> (Madrid, 1876); <i>El
Certamen de Cremona</i> (Madrid, 1906); <i>El Campanere
de Begoña</i> (Madrid, 1878); <i>El Barberillo
en Orán</i>; <i>Corona contra Corona</i> (Madrid, 1879);
<i>Les Amores de un Príncipe</i> (Madrid, 1881); <i>El
Clavel Rojo</i> (1899); <i>Covadonga</i> (1901); and <i>El
Domingo de Ramos</i>, words by Echegaray (Madrid,
1894). His works for orchestra include:
<i>En la Alhambra</i>, <i>Los Galeotes</i>, and <i>Escenas Andaluzas</i>,
a suite. He has written three string
quartets, a piano trio, a piano quintet, and an
oratorio in two parts, <i>El Apocalipsis</i>.</p>

<p>Bretón is largely self-taught, and there is a
legend that he devoured by himself Eslava’s
“School of Composition.” He further wrote the
music and conducted for a circus for a period of
years. In the late seventies he conducted an
orchestra, founding a new society, the Union
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>Artistico Musical, which is said to have been the
beginning of the modern movement in Spain. It
may throw some light on Spanish musical taste
at this period to mention the fact that the performance
of Saint-Saëns’s <i>Danse macabre</i> almost
created a riot. Later Bretón travelled. He appeared
as conductor in London, Prague, and
Buenos Ayres, among other cities outside of
Spain, and when Dr. Karl Muck left Prague for
Berlin, he was invited to succeed him in the Bohemian
capital. In the contest held by the periodical
“Blanco y Negro” in 1913 to decide who
was the most popular writer, poet, painter, musician,
sculptor, and toreador in Spain, Bretón as
musician got the most votes.... He is at present
the head of the Royal Conservatory in Madrid.</p>

<p>No Spanish composer (ancient or modern) is
better known outside of Spain than Isaac Albeniz
(born May 29, 1861, at Comprodon; died at
Cambo, in the Pyrenees, May 25, 1909). His
fame rests almost entirely on twelve piano pieces
(in four books) entitled collectively <i>Iberia</i>, with
which all concert-goers are familiar. They have
been performed here by Ernest Schelling, Leo Ornstein,
and George Copeland, among other virtuosi....
I think one or two of these pieces must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>in the répertoire of every modern pianist.
Albeniz did not imbibe his musical culture in Spain
and to the day of his death he was more friendly
with the modern French group of composers than
with those of his native land. In his music he
sees Spain with French eyes. He studied at Paris
with Marmontel; at Brussels with Louis Brassin;
and at Weimar with Liszt (he is mentioned in the
long list of pupils in Huneker’s biography of
Liszt, but there is no further account of him in
that book); he studied composition with Jadassohn,
Joseph Dupont, and F. Kufferath. His
symphonic poem, <i>Catalonia</i>, has been performed
in Paris by the Colonne Orchestra. I have no
record of any American performance. For a
time he devoted himself to the piano. He was a
virtuoso and he has even played in London, but
later in life he gave up this career for composition.
He wrote several operas and zarzuelas,
among them a light opera, <i>The Magic Opal</i> (produced
in London, 1893), <i>Enrico Clifford</i> (Barcelona,
1894; later heard in London), <i>Pepita
Jiminez</i> (Barcelona, 1895; afterwards given at
the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels), and <i>San
Anton de la Florida</i> (produced in Brussels as
<i>l’Ermitage Fleurie</i>). He left unfinished at his
death another opera destined for production in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>Brussels at the Monnaie, <i>Merlin l’Enchanteur</i>.
None of his operas, with the exception of <i>Pepita
Jiminez</i>, which has been performed, I am told, in
all Spanish countries, achieved any particular
success, and it is <i>Iberia</i> and a few other piano
pieces which will serve to keep his memory green.</p>

<p>Juan Bautista Pujol (1836-1898) gained considerable
reputation in Spain as a pianist and as
a teacher of and composer for that instrument.
He also wrote a method for piano students entitled
“Nuevo Mecanismo del Piano.” His further
claim to attention is due to the fact that he
was one of the teachers of Granados.</p>

<p>The names of Pahissa (both as conductor and
composer; one of his symphonic works is called
<i>The Combat</i>), Garcia Robles, represented by an
<i>Epitalame</i>, and Gibert, with two <i>Marines</i>, occur on
the programmes of the two concerts devoted in
the main to Spanish music, at the second of which
(Barcelona, 1910; conductor Franz Beidler) Granados’s
<i>Dante</i> was performed.</p>

<p>E. Fernandez Arbós (born in Madrid, December
25, 1863) is better known as a conductor and
violinist than as composer. Still, he has written
music, especially for his own instrument. He was
a pupil of both Vieuxtemps and Joachim; and he
has travelled much, teaching at the Hamburg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>Conservatory, and acting as concertmaster for the
Boston Symphony and the Glasgow Orchestras.
He has been a professor at the Madrid conservatory
for some time, giving orchestral and
chamber music concerts, both there and in London.
He has written at least one light opera, presumably
a zarzuela, <i>El Centro de la Tierra</i> (Madrid;
December 22, 1895); three trios for piano
and strings, songs, and an orchestral suite.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the Valverdes, father
and son. The father, in collaboration with Federico
Chueca, wrote <i>La Gran Via</i>. Many another
popular zarzuela is signed by him. The son has
lived so long in France that much of his music is
cast in the style of the French music hall; too it
is in a popular vein. Still in his best tangos he
strikes a Spanish folk-note not to be despised.
He wrote the music for the play, <i>La Maison de
Danse</i>, produced, with Polaire, at the Vaudeville
in Paris, and two of his operettas, <i>La Rose de
Grenade</i> and <i>l’Amour en Espagne</i>, have been performed
in Paris, not without success, I am told by
La Argentina, who danced in them. Other modern
composers who have been mentioned to me are
Manuel de Falla, Joaquin Turina (George Copeland
has played his <i>A los Toros</i>), Usandihaga
(who died in 1915), the composer of <i>Los Golondrinos</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>Oscar Erpla, Conrado del Campo, and Enrique
Morera.</p>

<p>Enrique Granados was perhaps the first of the
important Spanish composers to visit North
America. His place in the list of modern Iberian
musicians is indubitably a high one; though it
must not be taken for granted that <i>all</i> the best
music of Spain crosses the Pyrenees (for reasons
already noted it is evident that some Spanish
music can never be heard to advantage outside of
Spain), and it is by no means to be taken for
granted that Granados was a greater musician
than several who dwell in Barcelona and Madrid
without making excursions into the outer world.
In his own country I am told Granados was admired
chiefly as a pianist, and his performances
on that instrument in New York stamped him as
an original interpretative artist, one capable of
extracting the last tonal meaning out of his own
compositions for the pianoforte, which are his
best work.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival in New York he stated
to several reporters that America knew nothing
about Spanish music, and that Bizet’s <i>Carmen</i> was
not in any sense Spanish. I hold no brief for
<i>Carmen</i> being Spanish but it is effective, and that
<i>Goyescas</i> as an opera is not. In the first place,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>its muddy and blatant orchestration would detract
from its power to please (this opinion might
conceivably be altered were the opera given under
Spanish conditions in Spain). The manuscript
score of <i>Goyescas</i> now reposes in the Museum of
the Hispanic Society, in that interesting quarter
of New York where the apartment houses bear the
names of Goya and Velasquez, and it is interesting
to note that it is a <i>piano</i> score. What has
become of the orchestral partition and who was
responsible for it I do not know. It is certain,
however, that the miniature charm of the <i>Goyescas</i>
becomes more obvious in the piano version,
performed by Ernest Schelling or the composer
himself, than in the opera house. The growth of
the work is interesting. Fragments of it took
shape in the composer’s brain and on paper seventeen
years ago, the result of the study of Goya’s
paintings in the Prado. These fragments were
moulded into a suite in 1909 and again into an
opera in 1914 (or before then). F. Periquet, the
librettist, was asked to fit words to the score, a
task which he accomplished with difficulty. Spanish
is not an easy tongue to sing. To Mme. Barrientos
this accounts for the comparatively small
number of Spanish operas. <i>Goyescas</i>, like many
a zarzuela, lags when the dance rhythms cease. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>find little joy myself in listening to “La Maja y el
Ruiseñor”; in fact, the entire last scene sounds
banal to my ears. In the four volumes of Spanish
dances which Granados wrote for piano (published
by the Sociedad Anónima Casa Dotesio in
Barcelona) I console myself for my lack of interest
in <i>Goyescas</i>. These lovely dances combine in
their artistic form all the elements of the folk-dances
as I have described them. They bespeak a
careful study and an intimate knowledge of the
originals. And any pianist, amateur or professional,
will take joy in playing them.</p>

<p>Enrique Granados y Campina was born July
27, 1867, at Lerida, Catalonia. (He died March
24, 1916; a passenger on the <i>Sussex</i>, torpedoed in
the English Channel.) From 1884 to 1887 he
studied piano under Pujol and composition under
Felipe Pedrell at the Madrid Conservatory. That
the latter was his master presupposed on his part
a valuable knowledge of the treasures of Spain’s
past and that, I think, we may safely allow him.
There is, I am told, an interesting combination of
classicism and folk-lore in his work. At any rate,
Granados was a faithful disciple of Pedrell. In
1898 his zarzuela <i>Maria del Carmen</i> was produced
in Madrid and has since been heard in Valencia,
Barcelona, and other Spanish cities. Five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>years later some fragments of another opera, <i>Foletto</i>,
were produced at Barcelona. His third opera,
<i>Liliana</i>, was produced at Barcelona in 1911.
He wrote numerous songs to texts by the poet,
Apeles Mestres; Galician songs, two symphonic
poems, <i>La Nit del Mort</i> and <i>Dante</i> (performed by
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for the first time
in America at the concerts of November 5 and 6,
1915); a piano trio, string quartet, and various
books of piano music (<i>Danzas Españolas</i>, <i>Valses
Poéticos</i>, <i>Bocetos</i>, <i>etc.</i>).</p>

<p>Historians of operatic phenomena have
observed that fashions in music change;
the popular Donizetti and Bellini of one
century are suffered to exist during the next only
for the sake of the opportunity they afford to
some brilliant songstress. New tastes arise, new
styles in music. Dukas’s generally unrelished (and
occasionally highly appreciated) <i>Ariane et Barbe-Bleue</i>
may not be powerful enough to establish a
place for itself in the répertoire, but its direct influence
on composers and its indirect influence on
auditors make this lyric drama highly important
as an indication of the future of opera as a fine
art. Moussorgsky’s <i>Boris Godunow</i>, first given in
this country some forty years after its production
in Russia, is another matter. That score contains
a real thrill in itself, a thrill which, once felt,
makes it difficult to feel the intensity of a Wagner
drama again: because Wagner is becoming just a
little bit old-fashioned. <i>Lohengrin</i> and <i>Tannhäuser</i>
are becoming a trifle shop-worn. They do not
glitter with the glory of a <i>Don Giovanni</i> or the
invincible splendour of an <i>Armide</i>. There are
parts of <i>Die Walküre</i> which are growing old.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>Now Wagner, in many ways the greatest figure as
opera composer which the world has yet produced,
could hold his place in the singing theatres for
many decades to come if some proper effort were
made to do justice to his dramas, the justice which
in a large measure has been done to his music.
This effort at present is not being made.</p>

<p>In the Metropolitan Opera House season of
1895-6, when Jean de Reszke first sang Tristan in
German, the opportunity seemed to be opened for
further breaks with what a Munich critic once
dubbed “Die Bayreuther Tradition oder Der missverstandene
Wagner.” For up to that time, in
spite of some isolated examples, it had come to be
considered, in utter misunderstanding of Wagner’s
own wishes and doctrines, as a part of the technique
of performing a Wagner music-drama to
shriek, howl, or bark the tones, rather than to sing
them. There had been, I have said, isolated examples
of German singers, and artists of other
nationalities singing in German, who had <i>sung</i>
their phrases in these lyric plays, but the appearance
in the Wagner rôles, in German, of a tenor
whose previous appearances had been made largely
in works in French and Italian which demanded
the use of what is called <i>bel canto</i> (it means only
<i>good singing</i>) brought about a controversy which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>even yet is raging in some parts of the world.
Should Wagner be sung, in the manner of Jean de
Reszke, or shouted in the traditional manner?
Was it possible to sing the music and make the
effect the Master expected? In answer it may be
said that never in their history have <i>Siegfried</i>,
<i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, and <i>Lohengrin</i> met with such
success as when Jean de Reszke and his famous associates
appeared in them, and it may also be said
that since that time there has been a consistent
effort on the part of the management of the Metropolitan
Opera House (and other theatres as
well) to provide artists for these dramas who could
sing them, and sing them as Italian operas are
sung, an effort to which opera directors have been
spurred by a growing insistence on the part of the
public.</p>

<p>It was the first break with the Bayreuth bugbear,
tradition, and it might have been hoped that
this tradition would be stifled in other directions,
with this successful precedent in mind; but such
has not been the case. As a result of this failure
to follow up a beneficial lead, in spite of orchestral
performances which bring out the manifold beauties
of the scores and in spite of single impersonations
of high rank by eminent artists, we are beginning
to see the Wagner dramas falling into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>decline, long before the appointed time, because
their treatment has been held in the hands of Cosima
Wagner, who—with the best of intentions,
of course—not only insists (at Bayreuth she is
mistress, and her influence on singers, conductors,
stage directors and scene painters throughout the
world is very great) on the carrying out of Wagner’s
theories, as she understands them, and even
when they are only worthy of being ignored, but
who also (whether rightly or wrongly) is credited
with a few traditions of her own. Wagner indeed
invented a new form of drama, but he did not have
the time or means at his disposal to develop an
adequate technique for its performance.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the Bayreuth version
of Wotan in <i>Die Walküre</i> which makes
of that tragic father-figure a boisterous, silly
old scold (so good an artist as Carl Braun,
whose Hagen portrait is a masterpiece, has followed
this tradition literally); we all know too well
the waking Brünnhilde who salutes the sun in the
last act of <i>Siegfried</i> with gestures seemingly derived
from the exercises of a Swedish <i>turnverein</i>,
following the harp arpeggios as best she may; we
remember how Wotan, seizing the sword from the
dead Fasolt’s hand, brandishes it to the tune of
the sword <i>motiv</i>, indicating the coming of the hero,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>Siegfried, as the gods walk over the rainbow bridge
to Walhalla at the end of <i>Das Rheingold</i>; we smile
over the tame horse which some chorus man, looking
the while like a truck driver who is not good to
animals, holds for Brünnhilde while she sings her
final lament in <i>Götterdämmerung</i>; we laugh aloud
when he assists her to lead the unfiery steed, who
walks as leisurely as a well-fed horse would towards
oats, into the burning pyre; we can still see
the picture of the three Rhine maidens, bobbing up
and down jerkily behind a bit of gauze, reminiscent
of visions of mermaids at the Eden Musée; we all
have seen Tristan and Isolde, drunk with the love
potion, swimming (there is no other word to describe
this effect) towards each other; and no perfect
Wagnerite can have forgotten the gods and
the giants standing about in the fourth scene of
<i>Das Rheingold</i> for all the world as if they were the
protagonists of a fantastic minstrel show. (At
a performance of <i>Parsifal</i> in Chicago Vernon
Stiles discovered while he was on the stage that his
suspenders, which held his tights in place, had
snapped. For a time he pressed his hands against
his groin; this method proving ineffectual, he finished
the scene with his hands behind his back,
pressed firmly against his waist-line. As he left
the stage, at the conclusion of the act, breathing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>a sigh of relief, he met Loomis Taylor, the stage
director. “Did you think my new gesture was
due to nervousness?” he asked. “No,” answered
Taylor, “I thought it was Bayreuth tradition!”)</p>

<p>These are a few of the Bayreuth precepts which
are followed. There are others. There are indeed
many others. We all know the tendency of
conductors who have been tried at Bayreuth, or
who have come under the influence of Cosima Wagner,
to drag out the <i>tempi</i> to an exasperating degree.
I have heard performances of <i>Lohengrin</i>
which were dragged by the conductor some thirty
minutes beyond the ordinary time. (Again the
Master is held responsible for this tradition, but
though all composers like to have their own music
last in performance as long as possible, the tradition,
perhaps, is just as authentic as the story
that Richard Strauss, when conducting <i>Tristan
und Isolde</i> at the Prinz-Regenten-Theatre in Munich,
saved twenty minutes on the ordinary time it
takes to perform the work in order to return as
soon as possible to an interrupted game of Skat.)</p>

<p>But it is not tradition alone that is killing the
Wagner dramas. In many instances and in most
singing theatres silly traditions are aided in their
work of destruction by another factor in hasty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>production. I am referring to the frequent liberties
which have been taken with the intentions of
the author. For, when expediency is concerned,
no account is taken of tradition, and, curiously
enough, expediency breaks with those traditions
which can least stand being tampered with. The
changes, in other words, have not been made for
the sake of improvement, but through carelessness,
or to save time or money, or for some other cognate
reason. An example of this sort of thing is
the custom of giving the <i>Ring</i> dramas as a cycle in
a period extending over four weeks, one drama a
week. It is also customary at the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York to entrust the rôle of
Brünnhilde, or of Siegfried, to a different interpreter
in each drama, so that the Brünnhilde who
wakes in <i>Siegfried</i> is not at all the Brünnhilde who
goes to sleep in <i>Die Walküre</i>. Then, although
Brünnhilde exploits a horse in <i>Götterdämmerung</i>,
she possesses none in <i>Die Walküre</i>; none of the
other valkyries has a horse; Fricka’s goats have
been taken away from her, and she walks to the
mountain-top holding her skirts from under her
feet for all the world as a lady of fashion might as
she ascended from a garden into a ballroom. At
the Metropolitan Opera House, and at other theatres
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>where I have seen the dramas, the decorations
of the scenes of Brünnhilde’s falling asleep and of
her awakening are quite different.</p>

<p>Naturally, ingenious explanations have been devised
to fit these cases. For instance, one is told
that animals are <i>never</i> at home on the stage.
This explanation suffices perhaps for the animals
which do not appear, but how about those which
do? The vague phrase, “the exigencies of the
répertoire,” is mentioned as the reason for the extension
of the cycle over several weeks, that and
the further excuse that the system permits people
from nearby towns to make weekly visits to the
metropolis. Of course, Wagner intended that
each of the <i>Ring</i> dramas should follow its predecessor
on succeeding days in a festival week. If
the <i>Ring</i> were so given in New York every season
with due preparation, careful staging, and the
best obtainable cast, the occasions would draw audiences
from all over America, as the festivals at
Bayreuth and Munich do indeed draw audiences
from all over the world. Ingenuous is the word
which best describes the explanation for the
change in Brünnhildes; one is told that the out-of-town
subscribers to the series prefer to hear as
many singers as possible. They wish to “compare”
Brünnhildes, so to speak. Perhaps the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>real reason for divergence from common sense is
the difficulty the director of the opera house would
have with certain sopranos if one were allowed the
full set of performances. As for the change in
the setting of Brünnhilde’s rock it is pure expediency,
nothing else. In <i>Die Walküre</i>, in which, between
acts, there is plenty of time to change the
scenery, a heavy built promontory of rocks is required
for the valkyrie brood to stand on. In
<i>Siegfried</i> and <i>Götterdämmerung</i>, where the scenery
must be shifted in short order, this particular
setting is utilized only for duets. The heavier elements
of the setting are no longer needed, and are
dispensed with.</p>

<p>The mechanical devices demanded by Wagner
are generally complied with in a stupidly clumsy
manner. The first scene of <i>Das Rheingold</i> is usually
managed with some effect now, although the
swimming of the Rhine maidens, who are dressed
in absurd long floating green nightgowns, is carried
through very badly and seemingly without an
idea that such things have been done a thousand
times better in other theatres; the changes of scene
in <i>Das Rheingold</i> are accomplished in such a manner
that one fears the escaping steam is damaging
the gauze curtains; the worm and the toad are silly
contrivances; the effect of the rainbow is never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>properly conveyed; the ride of the valkyries is
frankly evaded by most stage managers; the bird
in <i>Siegfried</i> flies like a sickly crow; the final
scene in <i>Götterdämmerung</i> would bring a laugh
from a Bowery audience: some flat scenery flaps
over, a number of chorus ladies fall on their knees,
there is much bulging about of a canvas sea, and a
few red lights appear in the sky; the transformation
scenes in <i>Parsifal</i> are carried out with as little
fidelity to symbolism, or truth, or beauty; and
the throwing of the lance in <i>Parsifal</i> is always
seemingly a wire trick rather than a magical one.</p>

<p>The scenery for the Wagner dramas, in all the
theatres where I have seen and heard them, has
been built (and a great deal of it in recent years
from new designs) with a seemingly absolute ignorance
or determined evasion of the fact that
there are artists who are now working in the theatre.
In making this statement I can speak personally
of performances I have seen at the Metropolitan
Opera House, New York; the Auditorium,
Chicago; Covent Garden Theatre, London; La
Scala, Milan; the Opéra, Paris; and the Prinz-Regenten-Theatre
in Munich. Are there theatres
where the Wagner dramas are better given? I do
not think so. Compare the scenery of <i>Götterdämmerung</i>
at the Metropolitan Opera House with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>that of <i>Boris Godunow</i>, and you will see how little
care is being taken of Wagner’s ideals. In the
one case the flimsiest sort of badly painted and
badly lighted canvas, mingled indiscriminately
with plastic objects, boughs, branches, etc., placed
next to painted boughs and branches, an effect
calculated to throw the falsity of the whole scene
into relief; in the other case, an example of a
scene-painter’s art wrought to give the highest effect
to the drama it decorates. Take the decoration
of the hall of the Gibichs in which long scenes
are enacted in both the first and last acts of <i>Götterdämmerung</i>.
The Gibichs are a savage, warlike,
sinister, primitive race. Now it is not necessary
that the setting in itself be strong, but it
must suggest strength to the spectator. There
is no need to bring stone blocks or wood blocks on
the stage; the artist may work in black velvet if
he wishes (it was of this material that Professor
Roller contrived a dungeon cell in <i>Fidelio</i> which
seemed to be built of stone ten feet thick). It will
be admitted, I think, by any one who has seen the
setting in question that it is wholly inadequate to
express the meaning of the drama. The scenes
could be sung with a certain effect in a Christian
Science temple, but no one will deny, I should say,
that the effect of the music may be greatly heightened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>by proper attention to the stage decoration
and the movement of the characters in relation to
the lighting and decoration. (I have used the
Metropolitan Opera House, in this instance, as a
convenient illustration; but the scenery there is
no worse, on the whole, than it is in many of the
other theatres named.)</p>

<p>The secret at the bottom of the whole matter is
that the directors of the singing theatres wish to
save themselves trouble. They will spend neither
money nor energy in righting this wrong. It is
easier to trust to tradition on the one hand and expediency
on the other than it would be to engage
an expert (one not concerned with what had been
done, but one concerned with what to do) to produce
the works. <i>Carmen</i> was losing its popularity
in this country when Emma Calvé, who had
broken all the rules made for the part by Galli-Marié,
enchanted opera-goers with her fantastic
conception of the gipsy girl. Bizet’s work had
dropped out of the répertoire again when Mme.
Bressler-Gianoli arrived and carried it triumphantly
through nearly a score of performances
during the first season of Oscar Hammerstein’s
Manhattan Opera House. Geraldine Farrar and
Toscanini resuscitated the Spanish jade a third
time. An Olive Fremstad or a Lilli Lehmann or a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>Milka Ternina can perform a like office for <i>Götterdämmerung</i>
or <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>; but it is to a
new producer, an Adolphe Appia or a Gordon
Craig, that the theatre director must look for the
final salvation of Wagner, through the complete
realization of his own ideals. It must be obvious
to any one that the more completely the meaning
of his plays is exposed by the decoration, the lighting
and the action, the greater the effect.</p>

<p>Adolphe Appia wrote a book called “Die Musik
und die Inscenierung,” which was published in German
in 1899. (An earlier work, “La mise-en-scène
du drame Wagnerien,” appeared in Paris in
1893.) Since then his career has been strangely
obscure for one whose effect on artists working at
stage decoration has been greater than that of any
other single man. In the second edition of his
book, “On the Art of the Theatre,” Gordon Craig,
in a footnote, speaks thus of Appia: “Appia,
<i>the foremost stage decorator of Europe</i> (the italics
are mine) is not dead. I was told that he was
no more with us, so, in the first edition of this
book, I included him among the shades. I first
saw three examples of his work in 1908, and I
wrote a friend asking, ‘Where is Appia and how
can we meet?’ My friend replied, ‘Poor Appia
died some years ago.’ This winter (1912) I saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>some of Appia’s designs in a portfolio belonging
to Prince Wolkonsky. They were divine; and I
was told that the designer was still living.”</p>

<p>Loomis Taylor, who, during the season of 1914-15,
staged the Wagner operas at the Metropolitan
Opera House (and it was not his fault that the
staging was not improved; there is no stage director
now working who has more belief in and
knowledge of the artists of the theatre than Loomis
Taylor) has written me, in response to a
query, the following regarding Appia: “Adolphe
Appia, I think, is a French-Swiss; he is a young
man. The title of the book which made him famous,
in its German translation, is ‘Die Musik
und die Inscenierung.’ It was translated from the
French by Princess Cantacuzène.... Five years
ago I was told by Mrs. Houston Stewart Chamberlain
that Appia was slowly but surely starving to
death in some picturesque surroundings in Switzerland.
I then tried to get various people in
Germany interested in him, also proposing him to
Hagemann as scenic artist for Mannheim. Two
years later, before his starving process had
reached its conclusion, I heard of him as collaborator
with Jaques-Dalcroze at his temple of
rhythm on the banks of the Elbe, outside of Dresden,
where, I think, up to the outbreak of the war,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>Appia was doing very good work, but what has become
of him since I do not know.</p>

<p>“His book is very valuable; his suggestions go
beyond the possibilities of the average Hof theatre,
while in Bayreuth they have a similar effect to
a drop of water upon a stone, sun-burned by the
rays of Cosima’s traditions. By being one of the
first—if not <i>the</i> first—to put in writing the inconsistency
of using painted perspective scenery
and painted shadows with human beings on the
stage, Appia became the fighter for plastic scenery.
His sketch of the <i>Walküren</i> rock is the most
beautiful scenic conception of Act III, <i>Die Walküre</i>,
I know of or could imagine. To my knowledge
no theatre has ever produced anything in conformity
with Appia’s sketches.”</p>

<p>In a letter to me Hiram Kelly Moderwell, whose
book, “The Theatre of To-day,” is the best exposition
yet published of the aims and results of
the artists who are working in the theatre, writes
as follows in regard to Appia: “Appia is now
with Dalcroze at Hellerau and I believe has designed
and perhaps produced all the things that
have been done there in the last year or two. Previous
to that I am almost certain he had done no
actual stage work. Nobody else would give him
free rein. But, as you know, he thought everything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>out carefully as though he were doing the
actual practical stage work.... By this time he
has hit his ‘third manner.’ It’s all cubes and
parallelograms. It sounds like hell on paper but
Maurice Browne told me it is very fine stuff.
Browne says it is as much greater than Craig as
Craig is greater than anybody else. All the recent
Hellerau plays are in this third manner. They
are lighted by Salzmann, indirect and diffused
lighting, but not in the Fortuny style. I imagine
the Hellerau stuff is rather too precious to go on
the ordinary stage.”</p>

<p>Mr. Moderwell’s description of Appia’s book is
so completely illuminating that I feel I cannot do
better than to quote the entire passage from “The
Theatre of To-day”: “Before his (Gordon
Craig’s) influence was felt, however, Adolphe Appia,
probably the most powerful theorist of the
new movement, had written his remarkable book,
‘Die Musik und die Inscenierung.’ In this, as an
artist, he attempted to deduce from the content of
the Wagner music dramas the proper stage settings
for them. His conclusions anticipated much
of the best work of recent years and his theories
have been put into practice in more or less modified
form on a great many stages—not so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>(if at all) for the Wagner dramas themselves,
which are under a rigid tradition (the ‘what the
Master wished’ myth), but for operas and the
more lyric plays where the producer has artistic
ability and a free hand in applying it.</p>

<p>“Appia started with the principle that the setting
should make the actor the all-important fact
on the stage. He saw the realistic impossibility
of the realistic setting, and destructively analyzed
the current modes of lighting and perspective effects.
But, unlike the members of the more conventional
modern school, he insisted that the stage
is a three-dimension space and must be handled so
as to make its depth living. He felt a contradiction
between the living actor and the dead setting.
He wished to bind them into one whole—the
drama. How was this to be done?</p>

<p>“Appia’s answer to this question is his chief
claim to greatness—genius almost. His answer
was—‘By means of the lighting.’ He saw the
deadliness of the contemporary methods of lighting,
and previsaged with a sort of inspiration the
possibilities of new methods which have since become
common. This was at a time when he had at
his disposal none of the modern lighting systems.
His foreseeing of modern practice by means of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>rigid Teutonic logic in the service of the artist’s intuition
makes him one of the two or three foremost
theorists of the modern movement.</p>

<p>“The lighting, for Appia, is the spiritual core,
the soul of the drama. The whole action should be
contained in it, somewhat as we feel the physical
body of a friend to be contained in his personality.
Appia’s second great principle is closely connected
with this. While the setting is obviously inanimate,
the actor must in every way be emphasized
and made living. And this can be accomplished,
he says, only by a wise use of lighting, since it is
the lights and shadows on a human body which reveal
to our eyes the fact that the body is ‘plastic’—that
is, a flexible body of three dimensions.
Appia would make the setting suggest only the atmosphere,
not the reality of the thing it stands
for, and would soften and beautify it with the
lights. The actor he would throw constantly into
prominence while keeping him always a part of the
scene. All the elements and all the action of the
drama he would bind together by the lights and
shadows.</p>

<p>“With the most minute care each detail of
lighting, each position of each character, in Appia’s
productions is studied out so that the dramatic
meaning shall always be evident. Hence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>any setting of his contains vastly more thought
than is visible at a glance. It is designed to serve
for every exigency of the scene—so that a character
here shall be in full light at a certain point,
while talking directly to a character who must be
quite in the dark, or that the light shall just touch
the fringe of one character’s robe as she dies, or
that the action shall all take place unimpeded,
and so on. At the same time, needless to say, Appia’s
stage pictures are of the highest artistic
beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In Appia’s design for the third act of <i>Die Walküre</i>,
so enthusiastically praised by Loomis Taylor,
the rock of the valkyries juts like a huge
promontory of black across the front of the scene,
silhouetted against a clouded sky. So all the figures
of the valkyries stand high on the rock and
are entirely silhouetted, while Sieglinde below in
front of the rock in the blackness, is hidden from
the rage of the approaching Wotan. Any one
who has seen this scene as it is ordinarily staged,
without any reference to beauty or reason, will
appreciate even this meagre description of an artist’s
intention, which has not yet been carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>out in any theatre with which I have acquaintance.</p>

<p>Appia’s design for the first scene of <i>Parsifal</i>
discloses a group of boughless, straight-stemmed
pines, towering to heaven like the cathedral group
at Vallombrosa. Overhead the dense foliage hides
the forest paths from the sun. Light comes in
through the centre at the back, where there is a
vista of plains across to the mountains, on which
one may imagine the castle of the Grail. He
places a dynamic and dramatic value on light
which it is highly important to understand in estimating
his work. For example, his lighting of the
second act of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> culminates in a
<i>pitch-dark</i> stage during the singing of the love-duet.
This artist has designed the scenery for all
the <i>Ring</i> and has indicated throughout what the
lighting and action shall be.</p>

<p>I do not know that Gordon Craig has turned
his attention to any particular Wagner drama, although
he has made suggestions for several of
them, but he could, if he would, devise a mode of
stage decoration which would make the plays and
their action as appealing in their beauty as the
music and the singing often now are. In his book,
“On the Art of the Theatre,” he has been explicit
in his descriptions of his designs for <i>Macbeth</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>the rugged strength and symbolism of his settings
and ideas for that tragedy proclaim perhaps his
best right to be a leader in the reformation of the
Wagner dramas, although, even then, it must be
confessed that Craig is derived in many instances
from Appia, whom Craig himself hails as the foremost
stage decorator of Europe to-day.</p>

<p>Read Gordon Craig on <i>Macbeth</i> and you will
get an idea of how an artist would go to work on
<i>Tristan und Isolde</i> or <i>Götterdämmerung</i>. “I see
two things, I see a lofty and steep rock, and I see
the moist cloud which envelops the head of this
rock. That is to say, a place for fierce and warlike
men to inhabit, a place for phantoms to nest
in. Ultimately this moisture will destroy the rock;
ultimately these spirits will destroy the men.
Now then, you are quick in your question as to
what actually to create for the eye. I answer as
swiftly—place there a rock! Let it mount high.
Swiftly I tell you, convey the idea of a mist which
hangs at the head of this rock. Now, have I departed
at all for one-eighth of an inch from the
vision which I saw in the mind’s eye?</p>

<p>“But you ask me what form this rock shall take
and what colour? What are the lines which are
the lofty lines, and which are to be seen in any
lofty cliff? Go to them, glance but a moment at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>them; now quickly set them down on your paper;
<i>the lines and their direction</i>, never mind the cliff.
Do not be afraid to let them go high; they cannot
go high enough; and remember that on a sheet of
paper which is but two inches square you can make
a line which seems to tower miles in the air, and
you can do the same on your stage, for it is all a
matter of proportion and has nothing to do with
actuality.</p>

<p>“You ask about the colours? What are the
colours which Shakespeare has indicated for us?
Do not first look at Nature, but look at the play
of the poet. Two, one for the rock, the man; one
for the mist, the spirit. Now, quickly, take and
accept this statement from me. Touch not a single
other colour, but only these two colours
through your whole progress of designing your
scenes and your costumes, yet forget not that each
colour contains many variations. If you are timid
for a moment and mistrust yourself or what I tell,
when the scene is finished you will not see with
your eye the effect you have seen with your mind’s
eye when looking at the picture which Shakespeare
has indicated.”</p>

<p>The producers of the Wagner music dramas do
not seem to have heard of Adolphe Appia. Gordon
Craig is a myth to them. Reinhardt does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>exist. Have they ever seen the name of Stanislawsky?
Do they know where his theatre is? Would
they consider it sensible to spend three years in
mounting <i>Hamlet</i>? Is the name of Fokine known
to them? of Bakst? N. Roerich, Nathalie Gontcharova,
Alexandre Benois, Theodore Federowsky?...
One could go on naming the artists of
the theatre. (Recently there have been evidences
of an art movement in the theatre in America.
Joseph Urban, first in Boston with the Boston
Opera Company, and later in New York with various
theatrical enterprises, may be mentioned as an
important figure in this movement. His settings
for <i>Monna Vanna</i> were particularly beautiful and
he really seems to have revolutionized the staging
of <i>revues</i> and similar light musical pieces. Robert
Jones has done some very good work. I think he
was responsible for the imaginative staging [in
Gordon Craig’s manner, to be sure] of the inner
scenes in the Shakespeare mask, <i>Caliban</i>. But I
would give the Washington Square Players credit
for the most successful experiments which have
been made in New York. In every instance they
have attempted to suit the staging to the mood of
the drama, and have usually succeeded admirably,
at slight expense. They have developed a good
deal of previously untried talent in this direction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>Lee Simonson, in particular, has achieved distinctive
results. I have seldom seen better work of
its kind on the stage than his settings for <i>The
Magical City</i>, <i>Pierre Patelin</i>, and <i>The Seagull</i>.
At the Metropolitan Opera House no account
seems to be taken of this art movement, although
during the season of 1915-16 in <i>The Taming of
the Shrew</i> an attempt was made to emulate the
very worst that has been done in modern Germany.)</p>

<p>For several years the Russian Ballet, under the
direction of Serge de Diaghilew, has been presenting
operas and ballets in the European capitals,
notably in London and Paris for long seasons
each summer (the Ballet has been seen in America
since this article was written). A number of artists
and a number of stage directors have been
working together in staging these works, which,
as a whole, may be conceded to be the most completely
satisfying productions which have been
made on the stage during the progress of this new
movement in the theatre. One or two of the German
productions, or Gordon Craig’s <i>Hamlet</i> in
Stanislawsky’s theatre, may have surpassed them
in the sterner qualities of beauty, the serious truth
of their art, but none has surpassed them in brilliancy,
in barbaric splendour, or in their almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>complete solution of the problems of mingling people
with painted scenery. The Russians have
solved these problems by a skilful (and passionately
liberal) use of colour and light. The painted
surfaces are mostly flat, to be sure, and crudely
painted, but the tones of the canvas are so divinely
contrived to mingle with the tones of the costumes
that the effect of an animated picture is arrived
at with seemingly very little pother. This method
of staging is not, in most instances, it must be admitted,
adapted to the requirements of the Wagner
dramas. Bakst, I imagine, would find it difficult
to cramp his talents in the field of Wagnerism,
though he should turn out a very pretty edition
of <i>Das Rheingold</i>. Roerich, on the other
hand, who designed the scenery and costumes for
<i>Prince Igor</i> as it was presented in Paris and London
in the summer of 1914, would find no difficulty
in staging <i>Götterdämmerung</i>. The problem is the
same: to convey an impression of barbarism and
strength. One scene I remember in Borodine’s
opera in which an open window, exposing only a
clear stretch of sky—the rectangular opening
occupied half of the wall at the back of the room—was
made to act the drama. A few red lights
skilfully played on the curtain representing the
sky made it seem as if in truth a city were burning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>and I thought how a similar simple contrivance
might make a more imaginative final scene for <i>Götterdämmerung</i>.</p>

<p>It is, however, in their handling of mechanical
problems that the Russians could assist the new
producer of the Wagner dramas to his greatest
advantage. In Rimsky-Korsakow’s opera, <i>The
Golden Cock</i>, for instance, the bird of the title has
several appearances to make. Now there was no
attempt made, in the Russians’ stage version of
this work, to have this bird jiggle along a supposedly
invisible wire, in reality quite visible, flapping
his artificial wings and wiggling his insecure
feet, as in the usual productions of <i>Siegfried</i>. Instead
the bird was built solid like a bronze cock for
a drawing-room table; he did not flap his wings;
his feet were motionless; when the action of the
drama demanded his presence he was let down on a
wire; there was no pretence of a lack of machinery.
The effect, however, was vastly more imaginative
and diverting than that in <i>Siegfried</i>, because it
was more simple. In like manner King Dodon,
in the same opera, mounted a wooden horse on
wheels to go to the wars, and the animals he captured
were also made of wood, studded with brilliant
beads. In Richard Strauss’s ballet, <i>The
Legend of Joseph</i>, the figure of the guardian angel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>was not let down on a wire from the flies as he
might have been in a Drury Lane pantomime; the
naïve nature of the work was preserved by his
nonchalant entrance across the <i>loggia</i> and down a
flight of steps, exactly the entrance of all the human
characters of the ballet. I do not mean to
suggest that these particular expedients would fit
into the Wagner dramas so well as they do into
works of a widely different nature. They should,
however, indicate to stage directors the possibility
of finding a method to suit the case in each instance.
And I do assert, without hope or fear of
contradiction, that Brünnhilde with a wooden
horse would challenge less laughter than she does
with the sorry nags which are put at her disposal
and which Siegfried later takes down the river
with him. It is only down the river that one can
sell such horses. As for the bird, there are bird
trainers whose business it is to teach pigeons to
fly from pillar to post in the music halls; their
services might be contracted for to make that passage
in <i>Siegfried</i> a little less distracting. The difficulties
connected with this particular mechanical
episode (and a hundred others) might be avoided
by a different lighting of the scene. If the tree-tops
of the forest were submerged in the deepest
shadows, as well they might be, the flight of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>bird on a wire might be accomplished with some
sort of illusion. But why should one see the bird
at all? One hears it constantly as it warbles advice
to the hero.</p>

<p>The new Wagner producer must possess many
qualities if he wishes to place these works on a
plane where they may continue to challenge the admiration
of the world. Wagner himself was more
concerned with his ideals than he was with their
practical solution. Besides, it must be admitted
that taste in stage art and improvements in stage
mechanism have made great strides in the last
decade. The plaster wall, for instance, which has
replaced in many foreign theatres the flapping,
swaying, wrinkled, painted canvas sky cyclorama
(still in use at the Metropolitan Opera House; a
vast sum was paid for it a few years ago) is a new
invention and one which, when appropriately
lighted, perfectly counterfeits the appearance of
the sky in its different moods. (So far as I know
the only theatre in New York with this apparatus
is the Neighborhood Playhouse on Grand Street.)
In Houston Stewart Chamberlain’s “Richard
Wagner,” published in 1897, I find the following:</p>

<p>“Wagner foresaw that in the new drama the
whole principle of the stage scenery must undergo
a complete alteration but did not particularize in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>detail. The <i>Meister</i> says that ‘music resolves the
rigid immovable groundwork of the scenery into a
liquid, yielding, ethereal surface, capable of receiving
impressions’; but to prevent a painful
conflict between what is seen and what is heard,
the stage picture, too, must be relieved from the
curse of rigidity which now rests upon it. The
only way of doing this is by managing the light in
a manner which its importance deserves, that its
office may no longer be confined to illuminating
painted walls.... I am convinced that the next
great advance in the drama will be of this nature,
in the art of the eye, and not in music.” (The
passage quoted further refers to Appia’s first book,
published in French. Chamberlain was a close
friend of Appia and “Die Musik und die Inscenierung”
is dedicated to him.)</p>

<p>It must also be understood that Wagner in some
instances, when the right medium of his expression
was clear to him, made concessions to what he considered
the unintelligence of the public. Wotan’s
waving of the sword is a case in point. The <i>motiv</i>
without the object he did not think would carry
out the effect he intended to convey, although the
absurdity of Wotan’s founding his new humanity
on the power of the degenerate giants must have
been apparent to him. Sometimes the Master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>changed his mind. Paris would have none of
<i>Tannhäuser</i> without a ballet and so Wagner rewrote
the first act and now the Paris version of the
opera is the accepted one. In any case it must
be apparent that what Wagner wanted was a
fusion of the arts, and a completely artistic one.
So that if any one can think of a better way of
presenting his dramas than one based on the very
halting staging which he himself devised (with the
limited means at his command) as perhaps the best
possible to exploit his ideals, that person should be
hailed as Wagner’s friend. It must be seen, at
any current presentation of his dramas, that his
way, or Cosima’s, is not the best way. The single
performances which have made the deepest impression
on the public have deviated the farthest from
tradition. Olive Fremstad’s Isolde was far from
traditional. Her very costume of deep green was
a flaunt in the face of Wagner’s conventionally
white robed heroine. In the first act, after taking
the love potion, she did not indulge in any of the
swimming movements usually employed by sopranos
to pass the time away until the occasion
came to sing again. She stood as a woman dazed,
passing her hands futilely before her eyes, and it
was to be noted that in some instances her action
had its supplement in the action of the tenor who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>was singing with her, although, in other instances,
he would continue to swim in the most highly approved
Bayreuth fashion. But Olive Fremstad,
artist that she was, could not completely divorce
herself from tradition; in some cases she held to it
against her judgment. The stage directions for
the second act of <i>Parsifal</i>, for example, require
Kundry to lie on her couch, tempting the hero, for
a very long time. Great as Fremstad’s Kundry
was, it might have been improved if she had allowed
herself to move more freely along the lines
that her artistic conscience dictated. Her Elsa
was a beautiful example of the moulding of the traditional
playing of a rôle into a picturesque, imaginative
figure, a feat similar to that which Mary
Garden accomplished in her delineation of Marguerite
in <i>Faust</i>. Mme. Fremstad always sang
Brünnhilde in <i>Götterdämmerung</i> throughout with
the fire of genius. This was surely some wild creature,
a figure of Greek tragedy, a Norse Elektra.
The superb effect she wrought, at her first performance
in the rôle, with the scene of the spear,
was never tarnished in subsequent performances.
The thrill was always there.</p>

<p>In face of acting and singing like that one can
afford to ignore Wagner’s theory about the wedding
of the arts. A Fremstad or a Lehmann can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>carry a Wagner drama to a triumphant conclusion
with few, if any, accessories, but great singing
artists are rare; nor does a performance of this
kind meet the requirements of the Wagner ideal,
in which the picture, the word, and the tone shall
all be a part of the drama (<i>Wort-Tondrama</i>).
Wagner invented a new form of stage art but only
in a small measure did he succeed in perfecting a
method for its successful presentation. The
artist-producer must arise to repair this deficiency,
to become the dominating force in future performances,
to see that the scenes are painted in accordance
with the principles of beauty and dramatic
fitness, to see that they are lighted to express
the secrets of the drama, as Appia says they
should be, to see that the action is sympathetic
with the decoration, and that the decoration never
encumbers the action, that the lighting assists
both. There never has been a production of the
<i>Ring</i> which has in any sense realized its true possibilities,
the ideal of Wagner.</p>

<p>It is from the enemy that one learns. Richelieu
and other great men have found it folly
to listen to the advice of friends when rancour,
hatred, and jealousy inspired much more helpful
suggestions. And it occurred to me recently that
the friends of modern music were doing nothing by
way of describing it. They are content to like
it. I must confess that I have been one of these.
I have heard first performances of works by Richard
Strauss and Claude Debussy on occasions when
the programme notes gave one cause for dread.
At these times I have often been pleasurably excited
and I have never lacked for at least a measured
form of enjoyment except when I found those
gods growing a bit old. The English critics were
right when they labelled <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>
Handelian. The latest recital of Leo Ornstein’s
which I heard made me realize that even the extreme
modern music evidently protrudes no great
perplexities into my ears. They accept it all, a
good deal of it with avidity, some with the real
tribute of astonishment which goes only to genius.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think, I should have found it impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>to write this article which, with a new
light shining on my paper, is dancing from under
my darting typewriter keys, if I had not stumbled
by good luck into the camp of the enemy. For I
find misunderstanding, lack of sympathy, and
enmity towards the new music to a certain degree
inspirational. These qualities, projected, have
crystallized impressions in my mind, which might,
under other circumstances, have remained vague
and, in a sense, I think I may make bold to say,
they have made it possible for me to synthesize to
a greater degree than has hitherto been attempted,
the various stimuli and progressive gestures of
modern music. I can more clearly say now <i>why</i>
I like it. (If I were to tell others how to like it I
should be forced to resort to a single sentence:
“Open your ears”.)</p>

<p>A good deal of this new insight has come to me
through assiduous perusal of Mr. Richard Aldrich’s
comment on musical doings in the columns
of the “New York Times.” Mr. Aldrich, like
many another, has been bewildered and annoyed by
a good deal of the modern music played (Heaven
knows that there is little enough modern music
played in New York. Up to date [April 16,
1916] there has been nothing of Arnold Schoenberg
performed this season later than his <i>Pelléas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>und Mélisande</i> and his <i>Kammersymphonie</i>; of
Strawinsky—aside from the three slight pieces
for string quartet—nothing later than <i>Petrouchka</i>.
Such new works as John Alden Carpenter’s
<i>Adventures in a Perambulator</i> and Enrique
Granados’s <i>Goyescas</i>—as an opera—do
not seriously overtax the critical ear) but he has
done more than some others by way of expressing
the causes of this bewilderment and this annoyance.
Some critics neglect the subject altogether
but Mr. Aldrich at least attempts to be explanatory.
My first excerpt from his writings is
clipped from an article in the “New York Times”
of December 5, 1915, devoted to the string quartet
music of Strawinsky, performed by the Flonzaleys
at Æolian Hall in New York on the evening
of November 30:</p>

<p>“So far as this particular type of ‘futurist’
music is concerned it seems to be conditioned on an
accompaniment of something else to explain it from
beginning to end.”</p>

<p>Is this a reproach? The context would seem
to indicate that it is. If so it seems a late date
in which to hurl anathema at programme music.
One would have fancied that that battle had already
been fought and won by Ernest Newman,
Frederick Niecks, and Lawrence Gilman, to name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>a few of the gladiators for the cause. Why Mr.
Aldrich, having swallowed whole, so to speak, the
tendency of music during a century of its development,
should suddenly balk at music which requires
explanation I cannot imagine. However,
this would seem to be the point he makes in face
of the fact that at least two-thirds of a symphony
society’s programme is made up of programme music.
Berlioz said in the preface to his <i>Symphonie
Fantastique</i>, “The plan of an instrumental drama,
being without words, requires to be explained beforehand.
The programme (which is indispensable
to the perfect comprehension of the dramatic
plan of the work) ought therefor to be considered
in the light of the spoken text of an opera, serving
to ... indicate the character and expression.”
Ernest Newman built up an elaborate theory on
these two sentences, a theory fully expounded in
an article called “Programme Music” published
in “Music Studies” (1905), and touched on elsewhere
in his work (at some length, of course, in
his “Richard Strauss.”) He brings out the facts.
Representation of natural sounds, emotions, and
even objects—or attempts at it—in early music
were not rare. He cites the justly famous <i>Bible
Sonatas</i> of Kuhnau, Rameau’s <i>Sighs</i> and <i>Tender
Plants</i>, Dittersdorf’s twelve programme symphonies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>illustrating Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, and
John Sebastian Bach’s <i>Capriccio on the Departure
of my Dearly Beloved Brother</i>. Beethoven wrote
a <i>Pastoral Symphony</i> in which he attempted to
imitate the sound of a brook and the call of a
cuckoo. There is also a storm in this symphony.
The fact that Beethoven denied any intention of
portraying anything but “pure emotion” in this
symphony is evasion and humbug as Newman very
clearly points out. From what do these emotions
arise? The answer is, From the contemplation of
country scenes. The auditor without a programme
will not find the symphony so enjoyable
as the one who <i>knows</i> what awakened the emotions
in the composer. Beethoven wrote a “battle”
symphony too, a particularly bad one, I believe (I
have never seen it announced for performance).
It is true, however, that most of the composers of
the “great” period were content to number their
symphonies and to call their piano pieces impromptus,
sonatas, valses, and nocturnes. Nous
avons changé tout cela. Schumann was one of the
first of the composers of the nineteenth century to
write music with titles. In the <i>Carneval</i>, for example,
each piece is explained by its title. And
explanations, or shadows of explanations (Cathedral,
Rhenish, Spring, etc.), hover about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>four symphonies. Berlioz, of course, carried the
principle of programme music to a degree that was
considered absurd in his own time. He wrote symphonies
like the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and the <i>Fantastique</i>
which had to be “explained from beginning
to end.” Liszt invented the symphonic poem
and composed pieces which are only to be listened
to after one has read the poem or seen the picture
which they describe. Richard Strauss rounded
out the form and put the most elaborate naturalistic
details into such works as <i>Don Quixote</i> and
<i>Till Eulenspiegel</i>. Understanding of this music
and complete enjoyment of it rely in a large measure
on the “explanation.” The <i>Symphonia Domestica</i>
and <i>Heldenleben</i> are extreme examples of
this sort of thing. What does Wagner’s whole
system depend on but “explanation”? How does
one know that a certain sequence of notes represents
a sword? Because the composer tells us so.
How does one discover that another sequence of
notes represents Alberich’s curse? Through the
same channel. Bernard Shaw says in <i>The Perfect
Wagnerite</i>: “To be able to follow the music of
<i>The Ring</i>, all that is necessary is to become familiar
enough with the brief musical phrases out of
which it is built to recognize them and attach a
certain definite significance to them, exactly as any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>ordinary Englishman recognizes and attaches a
definite significance to the opening bars of <i>God
Save the Queen</i>.” Modern music is full of this sort
of thing. It leans more and more heavily on titles,
on mimed drama, on “explanation.” Think of
almost all the music of Debussy, for example, <i>La
Mer</i>, <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>, <i>Iberia</i>, nearly all
the piano music; Rimsky-Korsakow’s <i>Scheherazade</i>,
<i>Antar</i>, and <i>Sadko</i> (the symphonic suite, not
the opera); Vincent d’Indy’s <i>Istar</i>; Borodine’s
<i>Thamar</i>; Dukas’s <i>l’Apprenti Sorcier</i>; Franck’s <i>Le
Chasseur Maudit</i> and <i>Les Eolides</i>; Saint-Saëns’s
<i>Phaëton</i>, <i>La Jeunesse d’Hercule</i>, and <i>Le Rouet
d’Omphale</i>; Busoni’s music for <i>Turandot</i>: the list
is endless and it is futile to continue it.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Aldrich would object, in most of these
instances the music stands by itself and it is possible
to enjoy it without reference to the titles. I
contend that this is just as true of Strawinsky’s
three pieces for string quartet (of course one never
will be sure because Daniel Gregory Mason explained
these pieces before they were played).
However Mr. Newman has already exploded a good
many bombs about this particular point and he has
shown the fallacy of the theory. Mr. Newman
concedes that a work such as Tschaikowsky’s overture
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, would undoubtedly “give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>intense pleasure to any one who listened to it as a
piece of music, pure and simple. But I deny,” he
continues, “that this hearer would receive as much
pleasure from the work as I do. He might think
the passage for muted strings, for example, extremely
beautiful, but he would not get from it
such delight as I, who not only feel all the <i>musical</i>
loveliness of the melody and the harmonies and the
tone colour, but see the lovers on the balcony and
breathe the very atmosphere of Shakespeare’s
scene. I am richer than my fellow by two or three
emotions of this kind. My nature is stirred on two
or three sides instead of only one. I would go further
and say that not only does the auditor I have
supposed get less pleasure from the work than I,
but he really does not hear Tschaikowsky’s work
at all. If the musician writes music to a play and
invents phrases to symbolize the characters and to
picture the events of the play, we are simply not
listening to <i>his</i> work at all if we listen to it in ignorance
of his poetical scheme. We may hear the
music but it is not the music he meant us to hear.”
And Mr. Newman goes on to berate Strauss for
not providing programmes for some of his tone-poems
(programmes, however, which have always
been provided by somebody in authority at the
eleventh hour). Niecks thinks that nearly all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>music has an implied programme: “My opinion
is that whenever the composer ceases to write
purely formal music he passes from the domain
of absolute music into that of programme music.”
(“Programme Music in the Last Four Centuries.”)
But Niecks does not hold that explanation
is always necessary, even if there is a programme.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances it seems a bit thick to
jump on Strawinsky for writing music which has
to be explained. Such pieces as <i>Fireworks</i> or the
<i>Scherzo Fantastique</i> need no more extended explanation
than the titles give them. His three
pieces for string quartet were listed without programme
at the Flonzaley concert and might have
been played that way, I think, without causing the
heavens to fall. But Strawinsky had told some
one that their general title was <i>Grotesques</i> and
that he had composed each of them with a programme
in mind, which was divulged. When the
music was played, in the circumstances, what he
was driving at was as plain as A. B. C. There
was no further demand made on the auditor than
that he prepare himself, as Schumann asked auditors
to prepare themselves to listen to the <i>Carneval</i>,
by thinking of the titles. In Strawinsky’s
opera, <i>The Nightingale</i>, the text of the opera
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>serves as the programme. There are no representative
themes; there is no “working-out.”
You are not required to remember <i>leit-motive</i> in
order to familiarize your emotions with the proper
capers to cut at particular moments when these
<i>motive</i> are repeated. You are asked simply to
follow the course of the lyric drama with open ears,
open mind, and open heart. Albert Gleizes, the
post-impressionist painter, once told me that he
considered the title an essential part of a picture.
“It is a <i>point de départ</i>,” he said. “In painting
a picture I always have some idea or object in
mind in the beginning. In my completed picture
I may have wandered far away from this. Now
the title gives the spectator the advantage of starting
where I started.” A title to a musical composition
gives an auditor a similar advantage. No
doubt Strawinsky’s <i>Fireworks</i> would make a nice
blaze without the name but the title gives us a picture
to begin with, just as Wagner gives us scenery
and text and action (to say nothing of a handbook
of representative themes) to explain the
music of <i>Die Walküre</i>....</p>

<p>An important point has been overlooked by those
who have watched painting and music develop during
the past century: while painting has become
less and less an attempt to represent nature, music
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>has more and more attempted concrete representation.
There has seemed, at times, to be an interchange
in progress in the values of the arts.
(“He [Cézanne] is the first of the great painters
to treat colour deliberately as music; he tests all
its harmonic resources,” Romain Rolland.) Observers
of matters æsthetic have frequently told us
that both of these arts were breaking with their
old principles and going on to something new but,
it would seem, they have failed to grasp the significance
of the change. Music, as it drops its
classic outline and form, the <i>cliché</i> of the studio
and the academy, becomes more and more like
nature, because natural sounds are not co-ordinated
into symphonies with working-out sections and
codas, first and second subjects, etc., while in
painting, in some of its later manifestations, the resemblance
to things seen has entirely disappeared.
This fact, at least one phase of it, was realized in
concrete form by the futurists in Italy who asserted
that polyphony, fugue, etc., were contraptions
of a bygone age when the stage-coach was in
vogue. Machinery has changed the world. We
are living in a dynasty of dynamics. A certain
number of futurists even give concerts of noise
machines in which a definite attempt is made to
imitate the sounds of automobiles, aeroplanes, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>At a concert given at the Dal Verme in Milan, for
example, the pieces were called <i>The Awakening of
a Great City</i>, <i>A Dinner on the Kursaal Terrace</i>
(doubtless with an imitation of the guests eating
soup), and <i>A Meet of Automobiles and Aeroplanes</i>.</p>

<p>Picasso and Picabia have made us acquainted
with a form of art which in its vague realization of
representative values becomes almost as abstract
an art as music was in the time of Beethoven, while
such musicians as Strauss, Debussy, and Strawinsky,
have gradually widened the boundaries
which have confined music, and have made it at
times something very concrete. Debussy’s <i>La
Mer</i>, for example, is a much more definite picture
(in leaning over the rail of the gallery of the
Salle Gaveau in Paris during a performance of
this piece I actually became sea-sick!) than Marcel
Duchamp’s painting of the <i>Nu Descendant l’Escalier</i>.
So Strawinsky’s three pieces for string
quartet represent certain things in nature (the
first a group of peasants playing strange instruments
on the steppes; the second sounds in a Cathedral
heard by a drowsy worshipper, the responses
of the priest, chanted out of key, the shrill antiphonal
choruses; and the third a juggling Pierrot
with a soul-pain) much more definitely than Picasso’s
latest <i>Nature Morte dans un Jardin</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>
<p>“Now the law which has dominated painting for
more than a century is a more and more comprehensive
assimilation of musical idiom. Even Delacroix
spoke of ‘the mysterious effects of line and
colour which, alas, only a few adepts feel—like
interwoven themes in music ...’ and Baudelaire,
in another connection, wrote, ‘Harmony, melody,
and counterpoint are to be found in colour.’ Ingres
also remarked to his disciples, ‘If I could make
you all musicians you would be better painters.’
Renoir, who journeyed to Sicily to paint Wagner’s
portrait and to translate <i>Tannhäuser</i>, is a musical
enthusiast and his work is music. Maurice Denis
tells us that his pals at Julian’s Academy, those
who were to found synthesism with him, never
tired of discussing Lamoureux’s concerts, where
they were enthusiastic habitués. Gaugin announced
that ‘painting is a musical phase.’ He
speaks continually of the music of a picture; when
he wants to analyze his work he divides it into the
literary element, to which he attaches less importance,
and the musical element which he schemes
first. Cézanne, whom Gaugin compared to César
Franck, said, ‘not model, but modulate.’ Metzinger
invokes the right of cubist painters to express
all emotions as music does, and one of the
æstheticians of the new school writes: ‘The goal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>of painting is perhaps a music of nature, visual
music to which traditional painting would have
somewhat the status that sacred or dramatic music
has compared to concert music.’</p>

<p>“This, then, is the revolution in the art of line
and colour which has become aware of its intrinsic
power, independent of any subject. In truth,
even among the Venetians, as has been well said,
the subject was ‘only the background upon which
the painter relied to develop his harmonies,’ but
the mentality of spectators clings to this background
as to the libretto of an opera. At present,
an end to librettos: Pure music: those who wish
to comprehend it must first of all master its idiom,
for ‘Colour is learned as music is.’” (Romain
Rolland: “The Unbroken Chain,” Lee Simonson’s
translation.)</p>

<p>So far, in spite of the protestations of horror
made by the academicians, the pedants, and the
Philistines, which would lead one to suppose a state
of complete chaos, there has not been a complete
abandonment of co-ordination, of selection, or of
intention, in either art. In fact, it seems to me,
that the qualities of intention and selection are
more powerful adjuncts of the artist than they
have been for many generations. In painting
colour and form are cunningly contrived to give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>us an idea, if not a photograph, and in music natural
(as well as unnatural) sounds are still arranged,
perhaps to a more extreme extent than
ever before.</p>


<p class="ph3">II</p>

<p>I wonder if all the suggestion music gives us is
associative. Sometimes I think so. Was it Berlioz
who remarked that the slightest quickening of
<i>tempo</i> would transform the celebrated air in <i>Orphée</i>
from “<i>J’ai perdu mon Euridice</i>” to “<i>J’ai trouvé
mon Euridice</i>”? Rossini found an overture
which he had formerly used for a tragedy quite
suitable for <i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>, and the interchangeable
values which Handel gave to secular
and sacred tunes are familiar to all music students.
Are minor keys really sad? Are major keys always
suggestive of joy? We know that this is not
true although one will be more sure of a ready response
of tears from a Western audience by resorting
to a minor key. In our music wedding
marches are usually in the major and funeral
marches usually in the minor modes. But almost
all Eastern music is in a minor key, love songs and
even cradle songs. Recall, or play over on your
piano, the Smyrnan lullaby (made familiar by
Mme. Sembrich) which occurs in the collection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>Grecian and oriental melodies edited by L. A.
Bourgault-Ducoudray.... Even the composers
who do not call their pieces by name and who
scorn the use of a programme, depend for some of
their most powerful effects on emotion created by
association ... and a new composer, be he indefatigable
enough, can rouse new associations in
us.... Why if three or four composers would
meet together and decide that the use of a certain
group of notes stood for the town pump, in time it
would be quite easy for other composers to use this
phrase in that connection <i>with no explanation
whatever</i>.</p>


<p class="ph3">III</p>

<p>“It is a mistake of much popular criticism,”
says Walter Pater, in the first two sentences of
his essay on “The School of Giorgione,” “to regard
poetry, music, and painting—all the various
products of art—as but translations into different
languages of one and the same fixed quantity
of imaginative thought, supplemented by certain
technical qualities of colour, in painting; of sound,
in music; of rhythmical words, in poetry. In this
way, the sensuous element in art, and with it almost
everything in art that is essentially artistic,
is made a matter of indifference; and a clear apprehension
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>of the opposite principle—that the
sensuous material of each art brings with it a
special phase or quality of beauty, untranslatable
into the forms of any other, an order of impressions
distinct in kind—is the beginning of all true
æsthetic criticism.”</p>

<p>Strawinsky, in a sense, is quite done with programme
music; at least he says that this is so.
“La musique est trop bête pour exprimer autre
chose que la musique” is his pregnant phrase,
which I cannot quote often enough. And in an
interview with Stanley Wise, which appeared in
the columns of the “New York Tribune” he further
says, “Programme music ... has been obviously
discontinued as being distinctly an
uncouth form which already has had its day;
but music, nevertheless, still drags out its life in
accordance with these false notions and conceptions.
Without absolutely defying the programme,
musicians still draw upon sources foreign
to their art.... The true inwardness of music
being purely acoustic, the art so expresses itself
without being concerned with feelings alien to its
nature.... Music in the theatre is still held in
bondage to other elements. Wagner, in particular,
is responsible for this servitude in which music
labours to-day.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>
<p>The greater part of Igor Strawinsky’s music,
up to date, is written to a programme, but these
remarks of the composer should not be incomprehensible
on that account. Somewhat later than
the performance of the three pieces for string
quartet, <i>The Firebird</i> and <i>Petrouchka</i> were performed
in New York and were hailed by the critics,
<i>en masse</i>, as most delightful works. But the music
depends for its success, they said, on the stage
action to explain it. I fancy this is true of many
operas which were written for the stage. <i>Siegfried</i>,
as a whole, would be pretty tiresome in concert
form and so would <i>La Fille du Regiment</i>.
And read what Henry Fothergill Chorley has to
say about the works of Gluck (“Modern German
Music”): “The most experienced and imaginative
of readers will derive from the closest perusal
of the scores of Gluck’s operas, feeble and distant
impressions of their power and beauty. The delicious
charm of Mozart’s melody—the expressive
nobility of Handel’s ideas—may in some measure
be comprehended by the student at the pianoforte
and the eye may assure the reader how masterly
is the symmetry of the vocal score with one,—how
rich and complete is the management of the instrumental
score, with the other master. But this
is in no respect the case with <i>Alceste</i>, the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span><i>Iphigénies</i> and <i>Armide</i>—it may be added, with
almost any opera written according to the canons
of French taste. That which appears thin, bald,
severe, when it is merely perused, is filled up,
brightens, enchants, excites, and satisfies, when it
is heard with action,—to a degree only to be believed
upon experience. Out of the theatre, three-fourths
of Gluck’s individual merit is lost. He
wrote for the stage.” That all this is true any
one who, like me, has taken the trouble to study
the scores of the Gluck operas, which are infrequently
performed, may have discovered for himself.
I have never heard <i>Alceste</i> and that lyric
drama, as a result, has never sprung to me from
the printed page as do the notes of <i>Orphée</i>, <i>Armide</i>,
and <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i>. I am convinced
of the depth of expression contained in its pages;
I am certain of its noble power, but only because
I have had a similar experience with other Gluck
music dramas, with which I have later become acquainted
in the theatre.</p>

<p>This theory in regard to <i>Petrouchka</i> and <i>The
Firebird</i> may be easily contradicted, however.
One listener told me that she got the complete picture
of the Russian fair by closing her eyes; it was
all in the music. The action, as a matter of fact,
she added, annoyed her. It is quite certain that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>the music of either of these works is delightful
when played on the piano; an average roomful of
people who like to listen to music will be charmed
with it. <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i> was hissed intolerantly
when it was performed as a ballet in
Paris but, later (April 5, 1914), when Pierre
Monteux gave an orchestral performance of the
work at a concert it was applauded as violently.</p>

<p>Strawinsky has, it is true, worked away from
<i>representation</i> (in the sense of copying nature or,
like Wagner, relying on literary formulas for his
effects) in his music, but he has written very little
that does not depend on a programme, either expressed
or implied. All songs of course are “explained”
by their lyrics. The <i>Scherzo Fantastique</i>
and <i>Fireworks</i> are programme music in the
lighter sense, and naturally the music of his ballets
and his opera depends for its meaning on the
stage action. What Strawinsky means to do, I
think—certainly what he has done—is to avoid
going outside his subject or requiring his listener
to do so. To understand the music of his opera
you need never have heard a real nightingale sing,
for the bird does not sing at all like a nightingale,
a fact which was not understood by the critics
when the work was first produced, and in <i>The
Sacrifice to the Spring</i> you will find no attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>made to ape natural sounds, although there was
ample opportunity for doing so.... Another
modern worker in tone, Leo Ornstein, in the accompaniment
to his cradle song (it is the same
<i>wiegenlied</i> set by Richard Strauss, by the way)
tries to give his hearers the mother’s overtones,
her thoughts about the child’s future, etc.; the
music, instead of attempting to express the exact
meaning of the poem, expresses <i>more</i> than the
poem.</p>

<p>And Mr. Ornstein once said to me, “What I
try to do in composing is to get underneath, to express
the feeling underneath—not to be photographic.
I do not think it is art to reproduce a
steam whistle but it is art to give the feeling that
the steam whistle gives us. That can never be
done by exact reproduction.... I should not
like a steam whistle introduced into the concert
room” (I had shamelessly suggested it) “...
but great, smashing chords....”</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Ornstein in his <i>Impressions of the
Thames</i> is as near actual representation as Whistler
or Monet ... certainly a musical impressionist.</p>

<p>Is anything true? I hope not. At dinner the
other evening a lady attempted to prove to me that
there were standards by which beauty could be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>judged and rules by which it could be constructed.
She was unsuccessful.</p>


<p class="ph3">IV</p>

<p>It has occurred to me that Mr. Aldrich meant
that he wanted the juxtaposition of notes explained
from beginning to end. Inspiration is not
always conscious ... one feels in the end whether
such a collocation is inevitable or not ... I wonder
if Beethoven could have explained one of his
last quartets or piano sonatas. I doubt it. Of
course, on the other hand, Wagner explained and
explained and explained.</p>


<p class="ph3">V</p>

<p>I am afraid that this quality alone, the fact
that the music needs explanation, is not the
rock on which Mr. Aldrich splits, so to speak.
He writes somewhere else in this same article:
“All he asks of his listeners is to forget all they
know about string quartet music.” Now this is
really too much. That is exactly what Strawinsky
does, and why shouldn’t he? Has not every
great composer done as much? To quote Ernest
Newman again (this time from his book “Richard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>Strauss”), “All the music of the giants of the
past expresses no more than a fragment of what
music can and some day will express. With each
new generation it must discover and reveal some
new secret of the universe and of man’s heart; and
as the thing uttered varies, the way of uttering it
must vary also. There is only one rational definition
of good ‘form’ in music—that which expresses
most succinctly and most perfectly the
state of soul in which the idea originated; and as
moods and ideas change, so must forms.” “The
true creator strives, in reality, after <i>perfection</i>
only,” writes Busoni, in “A New Æsthetic of
Music,” “and through bringing this into harmony
with <i>his own</i> individuality, a new law arises without
premeditation.” The very greatness of Beethoven
is due to the fact that he made a perfect
wedding of form and idea. His forms (in which
he broke with tradition in several important
points) were evolved out of his ideas. Now the
very writers who give Beethoven the credit for having
accomplished this successful revolution and
who write enthusiastically of Gluck’s “reform of
the opera,” object to any contemporary instances
of this spirit (Maurice Ravel “corrects” with
great care, I am told, the exercises of his pupils.
“He who breaks rules must first know them,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>says. And I have no disposition to quarrel with
this sort of reverence although I think it is sometimes
carried too far. However the critic attempts
to “correct” the finished pupil’s work,
from the work of the past—a sad and impossible
task). Why in the name of goodness should not
Strawinsky, or any other modern composer, for
that matter, be allowed to make us forget everything
we know about string quartets, if he is able?
Some of us would be grateful for the sensation.
Leo Ornstein in a recent article said, “The very
first step which the composer must be given the
privilege of insisting upon is that his listeners
should approach his work with no preconceived
notions of any kind; they must learn to allow absolute
and full freedom to their imaginations as it is
only under such circumstances that any new work
can be understood and appreciated at first. All
preconceived theories must be abolished, and the
new work approached through no formulas.”
And in the same article Mr. Ornstein relates how,
after he had played his <i>Wild Men’s Dance</i> to
Leschetizky that worthy pedagogue murmured,
amazed, “How in the world did you get all those
notes on paper!” That, unfortunately, concludes
Mr. Ornstein, is the attitude of the average
listener to modern music. A similar instance is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>related in the case of Strawinsky. He played
some measures of his ballet, <i>The Firebird</i>, on the
piano to his master, Rimsky-Korsakow, until the
composer of <i>Scheherazade</i> interposed, “Stop
playing that horrid thing; otherwise I might begin
to enjoy it.” And even the usually open-minded
James Huneker says in his essay on Arnold
Schoenberg (“Ivory, Apes, and Peacocks”), “If
such music-making is ever to become accepted,
then I long for Death the Releaser. More shocking
still would be the suspicion that in time I might
be persuaded to like this music, to embrace, after
abhorring it.” These phrases of Huneker’s remind
me of a personal incident. My father has
subscribed for the “Atlantic Monthly” since the
first issue and one of the earliest memories of my
childhood is connected with the inevitable copy
which always lay on the library table. On one
occasion, contemplating it, I burst into tears; nor
could I be comforted. My explanation, between
sobs, was, “Some day I’ll grow up and like a magazine
without pictures! I can’t bear to think of
it!” Well, there is many a man who weeps because
some day he may grow up to like music without
melody! Music <i>has</i> changed; of that there
can be no doubt. Don’t go to a concert and expect
to hear what you might have heard fifty years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>ago; don’t expect <i>anything</i> and don’t hate yourself
if you happen to like what you hear. Mr.
George Moore’s evidence on this point of receptiveness
is enlightening (Mr. George Moore who spoke
to me once of the “vulgar noises made by the Russian
Ballet”): “In <i>Petrouchka</i> the orchestra all
began playing in different keys and when it came
out into one key I was quite dazed. I don’t know
whether it is music but I rather liked it!”</p>

<p>Still another point is raised by Mr. Aldrich.
I quote from the “New York Times” of December
8, 1915; the reference is to the second string
quartet of David Stanley Smith, played by the
Kneisel Quartet (the italics are mine): “Mr.
Smith does not hesitate at drastic dissonance <i>when
it results from the leading of his part writing</i>.”
There at last we have the real nigger in the woodpile.
The relation between keys is so remote, the
tonalities are so inexplicable in a modern Strawinsky
or Schoenberg work that the brain, prepared
with a list of scales, refuses to take in the
natural impression that the ear receives. This sort
of criticism reminds me of a line which is quoted
from some London journal by William Wallace
in “The Threshold of Music,” “The whole
work is singularly lacking in contrapuntal interest
and depends solely for such effect as it achieves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>upon certain emotional impressions of harmony
and colour.” And, nearer home, I culled the following
from the “New York Sun” of December
12, 1915 (Mr. W. J. Henderson’s column), “This
is what is the matter with the futurists or post-impressionists
in music. They are tone colourists
and that is all.” (Amusingly enough Mr. Henderson
begins his remarks by praising Joseph
Pennell for writing an article in which the post-impressionist
painters were given a drubbing; this
article is treated with contumely and scorn by the
art critic of the “Sun” on the page opposite that
on which Mr. Henderson’s article appears.) In
all these cases you find men complaining because
a composer has done exactly what he started out
to do. F. Balilla Pratella in one of his futurist
manifestos discusses this point (the translation is
my own), “The fugue, a composition based on
counterpoint par excellence, is full of (such) artifices
even when it achieves its artistic balance in
the works of the great German Sebastian Bach.
Soul, intellectuality, and instinct are here fused in
a given form, in a given manifestation of art, an
art of its own times, historical and strictly connected
with the life, faith, and culture of that particular
period. Why then should we be compelled
or asked to live it over again at the distance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>several centuries?” And later, “We proclaim as
an essential principle of our futurist revolution
that counterpoint and fugue, stupidly considered
as one of the most important branches of musical
learning, are in our eyes only the ruins of the
old science of polyphony which extends from the
Flemish school to Bach. We replace them by
harmonic polyphony, logical fusion of counterpoint
and harmony, which allows musicians to escape
the needless difficulty of dividing their efforts
in two opposing cultures, one dead and the other
contemporary, and entirely irreconcilable, because
they are the fruits of two different sensibilities.”
To quote Busoni; again: “How important, indeed,
are ‘Third,’ ‘Fifth,’ and ‘Octave’! How
strictly we divide ‘consonances’ from ‘dissonances’—<i>in
a sphere where no dissonances can
possibly exist</i>!” When Bernard Shaw published
“The Perfect Wagnerite” he wrote for a public
which still considered Wagner a little in advance
of the contemporary in music. What did he say?
“My second encouragement is addressed to modest
citizens who may suppose themselves to be disqualified
from enjoying <i>The Ring</i> by their technical
ignorance of music. They may dismiss all
such misgivings speedily and confidently. If the
sound of music has any power to move them they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>will find that Wagner exacts nothing further.
There is not a single bar of ‘classical music’ in
<i>The Ring</i>—not a note in it that has any other
point than the single direct point of giving musical
expression to the drama. In classical music
there are, as the analytical programmes tell us,
first subjects and second subjects, free fantasias,
recapitulations, and codas; there are fugues, with
counter-subjects, strettos, and pedal points; there
are passacaglias on ground basses, canons and
hypodiapente, and other ingenuities, which have,
after all, stood or fallen by their prettiness as
much as the simplest folk-tune. Wagner is never
driving at anything of this sort any more than
Shakespeare in his plays is driving at such ingenuities
of verse-making as sonnets, triolets, and the
like. And this is why he is so easy for the natural
musician who has had no academic teaching. The
professors, when Wagner’s music is played to
them, exclaim at once, ‘What is this? Is it aria,
or recitative? Is there no cabeletta to it—not
even a full close? Why was that discord not
prepared; and why does he not resolve it correctly?
How dare he indulge in those scandalous
and illicit transitions into a key that has not one
note in common with the key he has just left?
Listen to those false relations. What does he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>want with six drums and eight horns when Mozart
worked miracles with two of each? The man is
no musician.’ The layman neither knows nor
cares about any of these things. It is the adept
musician of the old school who has everything to
unlearn; and I leave him, unpitied, to his fate.”
All Wagner asked his contemporaries to do, in
fact, was to forget all they knew about opera!</p>


<p class="ph3">VI</p>

<p>This piling up of Shaw on Huneker, these dips
into Newman and Niecks, are beginning to be formidable,
but one never knows what turn of the
road may lead the traveller to his promised land
and it is better to draw the map clearly even if
there be a confusion of choices. And so, just
here, I beg leave to make a tiny digression, to
point out that the new music is not so terrible as
all this explanation may have made it seem to be.
Granville Bantock talks learnedly of “horizontal
counterpoint” but his music is perfectly comprehensible.
Schoenberg writes of “passing notes,”
says there is no such thing as consonance and dissonance,
and “I have not been able to discover
any principles of harmony. Sincerity, self-expression,
is all that the artist needs, and he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>say only what he must say” but Mr. Huneker
points out that he has founded an order out of
his chaos, “that his madness is very methodical.
For one thing he abuses the interval of the fourth
and he enjoys juggling with the chord of the
ninth. Vagabond harmonies, in which the remotest
keys lovingly hold hands do not prevent the
sensation of a central tonality somewhere—in
the cellar, on the roof, in the gutter, up in the
sky.” Percy Grainger says he dreams of “beatless”
music without rhythm—at least academically
speaking—but he certainly does not write
it. F. Balilla Pratella writes pages condemning
dance rhythms and still more pages elaborating
a new theory for marking time (which, I admit,
is absolutely incomprehensible to me) and publishes
them as a preface to his <i>Musica Futurista</i>
(Bologna, 1912), a composition for orchestra,
which is written, in spite of the theories, and the
fantastic time signatures, in the most engaging
dance rhythms. Nor does his disregard for fugue
go so far as to make him unfriendly to scale; the
whole-tone scale prevails in this work. His dislike
for polyphony seems more sincere; there is a
great deal of homophonous effect. Leo Ornstein
has admitted to me that his “system” would be
fully understood in a decade or two. As for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>Strawinsky ... how the public joyfully and rapturously
takes to its heart his dissonances, and
even asks for more!</p>


<p class="ph3">VII</p>

<p>Vincent d’Indy, reported by Marcel Duchamp,
said recently that the philosophy of music is
twenty years behind that of the other arts.</p>


<p class="ph3">VIII</p>

<p>The fact that Schoenberg has written a handbook
of theory, explaining, after a fashion,
his method of composition has misled some
people. “Schoenberg is a learned musician,”
writes Mr. Aldrich (“New York Times,” December
5, 1915), “and his music is built up by
processes derived from methods handed down to
the present by the learned of the past, however
widely the results may depart from those hitherto
accepted.... There results what he chooses to
consider ‘harmony,’ the outcome of a deliberate
system, about which he theorizes and <i>has written
a book</i>” (the italics again are mine). Against
this train of reasoning (further on in the same
article it becomes evident that Mr. Aldrich is
annoyed with Strawinsky because he has not done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>likewise) it is pleasant to place the following
paragraph from Chorley’s “Modern German Music”:
“Mozart, it will be recollected, totally and
(for him) seriously, declined to criticize himself
and confess his habits of composition. Many
men have produced great works of art who have
never cultivated æsthetic conversation: nay, more,
who have shrunk with a secretly entertained dislike
from those indefatigable persons whose fancy
it is ‘to peep and botanize’ in every corner of
faëry land. It cannot be said that the analytical
spirit of the circle of Weimar, when Goethe was
its master-spirit did any great things for Music.”
Do not misunderstand Strawinsky’s silence
(which has only been relative, after all). It is
sometimes as well to compose as to theorize.
Some of the great composers have let us see into
their workshops (not that they have all consistently
followed out their own theories) and others
have not. In one pregnant paragraph Strawinsky
has expressed himself (he is speaking of <i>The
Nightingale</i>): “I want to suggest neither situations
nor emotions, but simply to manifest, to
express them. I think there is in what are called
‘impressionist’ methods” (“Mr. Strawinsky, on
the other hand, is a musical impressionist from
the start”: R. A. again) “a certain amount of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>hypocrisy, or at least a tendency towards vagueness
and ambiguity. That I shun above all
things, and that, perhaps, is the reason why my
methods differ as much from those of the impressionists
as they differ from academic conventional
methods. Though I often find it extremely hard
to do so, I always aim at straightforward expression
in its simplest form. I have no use for
‘working-out’ in dramatic or lyric music. The
one essential thing is to feel and to convey one’s
feelings.”</p>

<p>This idea of natural expression becomes associated
in any great composer’s mind with another
idea, the horror of the <i>cliché</i>. Each new giant
desires to express himself without resorting to the
thousand and one formulas which have been more
or less in use since the “golden age” of music
(whenever that was). Natural expression implies
to a certain extent the abandonment of the
<i>cliché</i>, for, under this principle, if a rule or a
habit is weighed and found wanting it is immediately
discarded.</p>

<p>“Routine (<i>cliché</i>) is highly esteemed and frequently
required; in musical ‘officialdom’ it is a
<i>sine qua non</i>,” writes Busoni. “That routine in
music should exist at all, and furthermore that
it can be nominated as a condition in the musician’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>bond, is another proof of the narrow confines
of our musical art. Routine signifies the
acquisition of a modicum of experience and art
craft, and their application to all cases which may
occur; hence, there must be an astounding number
of analogous cases. Now I like to imagine a
species of art-praxis wherein each case should be
a new one, an exception.” Even so early a composer
(using early in a loose sense) as Schumann
found it unnecessary, at times, to close a piece
with the tonic; and many other composers have
disregarded the rule since, leaving the ear hanging
in the air, so to speak. Is there any more
reason why all pieces should end on the tonic
than that all books should end happily or all
pictures be painted in black and white? In music
which Mozart wrote at the age of four there are
chords of the second (and they occur in music before
Mozart). In books of the period you can
read of the horror with which ears at the beginning
of the nineteenth century received consecutive
fifths. Some of the modern French composers
have disposed of the <i>cliché</i> of a symphony in
four movements. Chausson, Franck, and Dukas
have written symphonies in three parts. What
composer (even the most academic) ever followed
the letter of a precept if he found a better way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>of expressing himself? Moussorgsky avoided
<i>cliché</i> as he would have avoided the plague.
He took all the short cuts possible. There
are no preambles and addendas, or other doddering
concessions to scientific art in his music
dramas and his songs. He gives the words their
natural accent and the voice its natural inflections.
Death is not always rewarded with blows
on the big drum. The composer sometimes expresses
the end, quite simply, in silence. In all
the arts the horror of <i>cliché</i> asserts itself so violently
indeed that we find Robert Ross (“Masks
and Phases”) assailing Walter Pater for such a
fall from grace as the use of the phrase, “rebellious
masses of black hair.” Of course some small
souls are so busy defying <i>cliché</i>, with no adequate
reason for doing so, that they make themselves
ridiculous. And as an example of this
preoccupation I may tell an anecdote related to
me by George Moore. “For a time,” he said,
“Augusta Holmès was interested in an opera she
was composing, <i>La Montagne Noire</i>, to the exclusion
of all other subjects in conversation. She
talked about it constantly and always brought one
point forward: all the characters were to sing
with their backs to the audience. That was her
novel idea. She did not seem to realize that, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>itself, the innovation would not serve to make
her opera interesting.” Strawinsky’s horror of
<i>cliché</i> is by no means abnormal. He does not
break rules merely for the pleasure of shocking
the pedants. In each instance he has developed,
quite naturally and inevitably, the form out of
his material. In <i>Petrouchka</i>, a ballet with a Russian
country fair as its background, he has harped
on the folk-dance tunes, the hurdy-gurdy manner,
and, as befits this work, there is no great break
with tradition, except in the orchestration. <i>The
Firebird</i>, too, in spite of its fantasy and brilliance,
is perfectly understandable in terms of the chromatic
scale. In <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i>, on
the other hand, unhampered by the chains which
a “story-ballet” (the fable of these “pictures
of pagan Russia” is entirely negligible) inevitably
imply, he has awakened primitive emotions by
the use of barbaric rhythm, without any special
regard for melody or harmony, using the words in
their academic senses. There is no attempt made
to begin or end with major thirds. Strawinsky
was perhaps the first composer to see that melody
is of no importance in a ballet. <i>Fireworks</i> is
impressionistic but it is no more so (although the
result is arrived at by a wholly dissimilar method)
than <i>La Mer</i> of Debussy. But it is in his opera,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span><i>The Nightingale</i>, or his very short pieces for
string quartet, or his Japanese songs for voice
and small orchestra that the beast shows his
fangs, so to speak. It is in these pieces and in
<i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i> that Strawinsky has
accomplished a process of elision, leaving out some
of those stupidities which have bored us at every
concert of academic music which we have attended.
(You must realize how much your mind wanders
at a symphony concert. It is impossible to concentrate
one’s complete attention on the performance
of a long work except at those times when
some new phrase or some new turn in the working-out
of a theme strikes the ear. There is so
much of the music that is familiar, because it has
occurred in so much music before. If you hear
tum-ti-tum you may be certain it will be followed
by ti-ti-ti and a good part of this sort of thing
falls on deaf ears.... There are those, I am
forced to admit, who can only concentrate on
that which is perfectly familiar to them.) As a
matter of fact he gives our ears credit (by this
time!) for the ability to skip a few of the connecting
links. Now this sort of elision in painting
has come to be the slogan of a school. Cézanne
painted a woman as he saw her; he made
no attempt to explain her; that pleasure he left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>for the spectator of his picture. He did not draw
a fashion plate. The successors of Cézanne (some
of them) have gone much farther. They draw us
a few bones and expect us to reconstruct the
woman, body and soul, after the fashion of a professor
of anatomy reconstructing an ichthyosaurus.
Strawinsky and some other modern musicians
have gone as far; they have left out the
tum-ti-tums and twilly-wigs which connect the
pregnant phrases in their music.... This does
not signify that they do not <i>think</i> them, sometimes,
but it is not necessary for any one with a
receptive ear (not an <i>expectant</i> ear, unless it be
an ear which expects to hear something pleasant!)
to do so. In fact this kind of an auditor appreciates
these short cuts of composers, gives
thanks to God for them. Surprise is one of the
keenest emotions that music has in its power to
give us (even Hadyn and Weber discovered that!).
It is only the pedants and the critics, who, after
all, do not sit through all the long symphonies,
who are annoyed by these attempts at concentration
and condensation. (I say the pedants
but I must include the Philistines. It is really
<i>cliché</i> which makes certain music “popular.”
The public as a whole really prefers music based
on <i>cliché</i>, with a melody in which the end is foreordained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>almost from the first bar. Of course in
time public taste is changed.... The transition
is slow ... but the composer who follows public
taste instead of leading it soon drops out of hearing.
The <i>cliché</i> of to-day is not the <i>cliché</i> of day
before yesterday. According to Philip Hale,
Napoleon, then first consul [1800] said to Luigi
Cherubini, “I am very fond of Paisiello’s music;
it is gentle, peaceful. You have great talent,
but your accompaniments are too loud.” Cherubini
replied, “Citizen Consul, I have conformed
to the taste of the French.” Napoleon persisted,
“Your music is too loud; let us talk of
Paisiello’s which lulls me gently.” “I understand,”
answered Cherubini, “you prefer music
that does not prevent you from dreaming of
affairs of state.”) Strawinsky, working gradually,
not with the intention to astonish but with
no fear of doing so, dropping superfluities, and
all <i>cliché</i> of the studio whatsoever, arrives at a
perfectly natural form of expression in his lyric
drama, <i>The Nightingale</i>, in which there is no
working-out or development of themes; the music
is intended to comment upon, to fill with a bigger
meaning, the action as it proceeds, without resorting
to tricks which require mental effort on
the part of the auditor. The composer does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>wish to burden him with any more mental effort
than the mere listening to the piece requires and
he strikes to the soul with the poignancy of his
expression. (The foregoing may easily be misunderstood.
It does not mean necessarily that there
is no polyphony, that there are no parts leading
hither and thither in the music of Strawinsky.
It does not mean that dissonance has become an
end in itself with this composer. It simply means
that he has let his inspiration take the form natural
to it and has not tried to cramp his inspiration
into proscribed forms. There should be no
more difficulty in understanding him than in understanding
Beethoven once one arrives at listening
with unbiased ears. The trouble is that too
many of us have made up our minds not to listen
to anything which does not conform with our
own precious opinions.)</p>

<p>At the risk of being misunderstood by some and
for the sake of making myself clearer to others
I hazard a frivolous figure. Say that Wagner’s
formula for composition be represented by some
expression; I will choose the simple proverb,
“Make hay while the sun shines.” Humperdinck
is content to change a single detail of this formula.
He says, musically speaking, “Make
<i>wheat</i> while the sun shines.” Richard Strauss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>makes a more complete inversion. His paraphrase
would suggest something like this, “Make
brass while the band brays.” Strawinsky, wearied
of the whole business (as was Debussy before
him; genius does not paraphrase) uses only
two words of the formula ... say “make” and
“sun.” Later even these are negligible, as each
new composer makes his own laws and his own
formulas. The infinity of it! In time the work
of Strawinsky will establish a <i>cliché</i> to be scorned
by a new generation (scorned in the sense that it
will not be imitated, except by inferior men).</p>

<p>That his music is vibrant and beautiful we may
be sure and it has happened that all of it has been
appreciated by a very worth-while public. He
has done what Benedetto Croce in his valuable
work, “Æsthetic,” demands of the artist. He has
expressed himself ... for beauty is expression.
“Artists,” says this writer, “while making a verbal
pretence of agreeing, or yielding a feigned obedience
to them, have always disregarded (these)
<i>laws of styles</i>. Every true work of art has violated
some established class and upset the ideas
of the critics who have been obliged to enlarge
the number of classes, until finally even this enlargement
has proved too narrow, owing to the
appearance of new works of art, which are naturally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>followed by new scandals, new upsettings,
and—new enlargements.”</p>

<p>“It must not be forgotten,” says Egon Wellesz
(“Schoenberg and Beyond” in “The Musical
Quarterly,” Otto Kinkeldey’s translation), “that
in art there are no ‘eternal laws’ and rules. Each
period of history has its own art, and the art of
each period has its own rules. There are times
of which one might say that every work which
was not in accord with the rules was bad or amateurish.
These are the times in which fixed forms
exist, to which all artists hold fast, merely varying
the content. Then there are periods when artists
break through and shatter the old forms. The
greatness of their thoughts can no longer be confined
within the old limits. (Think of Beethoven’s
Ninth Symphony and the Symphonie Fantastique
of Berlioz.) There arises a category of art works
whose power and beauty can be <i>felt</i> only and not
<i>understood</i>. For this reason an audience that
knows nothing of rules will enthuse over works of
this kind much sooner than the average musician
who looks for the rules and their observance.”</p>

<p>Remember that Hanslick called <i>Tristan und
Isolde</i> “an abomination of sense and language”
and Chorley wrote “I have never been so blanked,
pained, wearied, <i>insulted</i> even (the word is not too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>strong), by a work of pretension as by ...
<i>Tannhäuser</i>....” “Fortunately,” I quote Benedetto
Croce again, “no arduous remarks are necessary
to convince ourself that pictures, poetry, and
every work of art, produce no effects save on souls
prepared to receive them.”</p>

<p>The clock continues to make its hands go round,
so fast indeed that it becomes increasingly difficult
to keep track of its course. For example, just
before his death, John F. Runciman in “Another
Ode to Discord” (“The New Music Review,”
April, 1916) seemed to present an entirely new
front. Here is a sample passage, “We have
grown used to dissonances and our ears no longer
require the momentary rest afforded by frequent
concords; if a discord neither demands preparation
nor resolution, and if it sounds beautiful and
is expressive, there is no reason on earth why a
piece of music should not consist wholly of a series
of discords.... From Monteverde to Scriabine
the line is unbroken, each successive generation
growing bolder in attacking dissonances and still
bolder in the manner of quitting them. I heard
a gentleman give a recital of his own pianoforte
works not long ago. They seemed to consist entirely
of minor seconds—B and C struck together—and
the effect to my mind was excruciatingly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>abominable. But that is how Bach’s music, Beethoven’s,
Wagner’s, struck their contemporaries;
and heaven knows what we shall get accustomed to
in time. One thing is certain—that the most
daring modern spirit is only following in the steps
of the mightiest masters....”</p>

<p>We may be on the verge of a still greater revolution
in art than any through which we have yet
passed; new banners may be unfurled, and new
strongholds captured. I admit that the idea gives
me pleasure. Try to admit as much to yourself.
Go hear the new music; listen to it and see if you
can’t enjoy it. Perhaps you can’t. At any rate
you will find in time that you won’t listen to second-rate
imitations of the giant works of the past
any longer. Your ears will make progress in spite
of you and I shouldn’t wonder at all if five years
more would make Schoenberg and Strawinsky and
Ornstein a trifle old-fashioned.... The Austrian
already has a little of the academy dust upon him.</p>

<p class="ph2">A New Principle in Music</p></div>


<p>Although Igor Strawinsky plainly proclaimed
himself a genius in <i>The Firebird</i>
(1909-10), it was in <i>Petrouchka</i> (1910-11)
that he began the experiment which established
a new principle in music. In these “scènes
burlesques” he discovered the advantages of a
new use of the modern orchestra, completely upsetting
the old academic ideas about “balance of
tone,” and proving to his own satisfaction the
value of “pure tone,” in the same sense that the
painter speaks of pure colour. And in this work
he broke away from the standards not only of
Richard Strauss, the Wagner follower, but also
of such innovators as Modeste Moussorgsky and
Claude Debussy.</p>

<p>Strauss, following Wagner’s theory of the <i>leit-motiv</i>,
rounded out the form of the tone-poem,
carried the principle of representation in music a
few steps farther than his master, gave new
colours to old instruments, and broadened the
scope of the modern orchestra so that it might
include new ones (in one of his symphonies Gustav
Mahler was content with 150 men!). Moussorgsky
(although his work preceded that of
Strauss, the general knowledge of it is modern),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>working along entirely different lines, strove for
truthful utterance and achieved a mode of expression
which usually seems inevitable. Debussy endowed
music with novel tints derived from the extensive,
and almost exclusive, use of what is called
the whole-tone scale, and instead of forcing his
orchestra to make more noise he constantly repressed
it (in all of <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> there is
but one climax of sound and in <i>l’Après-midi d’un
Faune</i> and his other orchestral works he is equally
continent in the use of dynamics).</p>

<p>Igor Strawinsky has not been deaf to the blandishments
of these composers. He has used the
<i>leit-motiv</i> (sparingly) in both <i>The Firebird</i> and
<i>Petrouchka</i>. He abandoned it in <i>The Sacrifice to
the Spring</i> (1913) and in <i>The Nightingale</i> (1914).
His powers of representation are as great as those
of Strauss; it is only necessary to recall the music
of the bird in <i>The Firebird</i>, his orchestral piece,
<i>Fireworks</i>, which received warm praise from a
manufacturer of pyrotechnics, and the street
organ music in <i>Petrouchka</i>. Later he conceived
the mission of music to be something different.
“La musique est trop bête,” he said once ironically,
“pour exprimer autre chose que la musique.”
In such an extraordinary work as <i>The
Nightingale</i> we find him making little or no attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>at representation. The bird does not sing
like the little brown warbler; instead Strawinsky
has endeavoured to write music which would give
the <i>feeling</i> of the bird’s song and the effect it made
on the people in his lyric drama to the auditors
in the stalls of the opera house. As for Strauss’s
use of orchestral colour the German is the merest
tyro when compared to the Russian. There is
some use of the whole-tone scale in <i>The Firebird</i>,
and elsewhere in Strawinsky, but it is not a predominant
use of it. In this “conte dansé” he
also suggests the <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> of Debussy
in his continent use of sound and the mystery and
esotericism of his effect. Strawinsky is more of
an expert than Moussorgsky; he handles his medium
more freely (has any one ever handled it
better?) but he still preaches the older Russian
doctrine of truth of expression, a doctrine which
implies the curt dismissal of all idea of padding.</p>

<p>But all these composers and their contemporaries,
and the composers who came before them,
have one quality in common; they all use the
orchestra of their time, or a bigger one. Strauss,
to be sure, introduces a number of new instruments,
but he still utilizes a vast number of violins
and violas massed against the other instruments,
diminishing in number according to the volume of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>sound each makes. He divides his strings continually,
of course; they do not all play alike as
the violins, say, in <i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>, but they
often all play at once.</p>

<p>Strawinsky experimented at first with the full
orchestra and he even utilized it in such late works
as <i>Petrouchka</i> and <i>The Nightingale</i>. However,
in his search for “pure tone” he used it in a new
way. In <i>Petrouchka</i>, for example, infrequently
you will hear more than <i>one of each instrument
at a time</i> and frequently two, or at most three,
instruments playing simultaneously will be sufficient
to give his idea form. The entire second
scene of this mimed drama, is written for solo
piano, occasionally combined with a single other
instrument. At other times in the action the
bassoon or the cornet, even the triangle has the
stage. And when he wishes to achieve his most
complete effects he is careful not to use more than
seven or eight instruments, and <i>only one of each</i>.</p>

<p>He experimented still further with this principle
in his Japanese songs, for voice and small
orchestra (1912). The words are by Akahito,
Mazatsumi, and Tsaraiuki. I have not heard
these songs with orchestral accompaniment (the
piano transcription was made by the composer
himself) but I may take the judgment of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>who have. I am told that they are of an indescribable
beauty, and instinct with a new colour,
a colour particularly adapted to the oriental
naïveté of the lyrics. The orchestra, to accompany
a soprano, consists of two flutes (one a little
flute), two clarinets (the second a bass clarinet),
piano (an instrument which Strawinsky almost
invariably includes in his orchestration), two
violins, viola and ’cello. This form of chamber
music, of course, is not rare. Chausson’s violin
concerto, with chamber orchestra, and Schoenberg’s
<i>Pierrot Lunaire</i> instantly come to mind, but
Strawinsky did not stop with chamber music. He
applied his new principle to the larger forms.</p>

<p>In his newest work, <i>The Village Weddings</i>, which
I believe Serge de Diaghilew hopes to produce, his
principle has found its ultimate expression, I am
told by his friend, Ernest Ansermet, conductor
of the Russian Ballet in America and to whom
Strawinsky dedicated his three pieces for string
quartet. The last note is dry on the score of
this work, and it is therefore quite possible to talk
about it although no part of it has yet been performed
publicly. According to Mr. Ansermet
there is required an orchestra of forty-five men,
each a virtuoso, <i>no two of whom play the same
instrument</i> (to be sure there are two violins but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>one invariably plays pizzicato, the other invariably
bows). There are novelties in the band but
all the conventional instruments are there including,
you may be sure, a piano and an infinite
variety of woodwinds, which always play significant
rôles in Strawinsky’s orchestration. And
Mr. Ansermet says that in this work Strawinsky
has achieved effects such as have only been dreamed
of by composers hitherto.... I can well believe
him.</p>

<p>He has made another innovation, following, in
this case, an idea of Diaghilew’s. When that impresario
determined on a production of Rimsky-Korsakow’s
opera, <i>The Golden Cock</i>, during the
summer of 1914 he conceived a performance with
two casts, one choregraphic and the other vocal.
Thus Mme. Dobrovolska sang the coloratura
rôle of the Queen of Shemakhan while Mme.
Karsavina danced the part most brilliantly on her
toes; M. Petrov sang the rôle of King Dodon,
which was enacted by Adolf Bolm, etc. In order
to accomplish this feat Mr. Diaghilew was obliged
to make the singers a part of the decoration.
Nathalie Gontcharova, who has been called in to
assist in the production of <i>The Village Weddings</i>,
devised as part of her stage setting two tiers of
seats, one on either side of the stage, extending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>into the flies after the fashion of similar benches
used at the performance of an oratorio. The
singers (principals and chorus together) clad in
magenta gowns and caps, all precisely similar, sat
on these seats during the performance and, after
a few seconds, they became quite automatically a
part of the decoration. The action took place in
the centre of the stage and the dancers not only
mimed their rôles but also opened and closed their
mouths as if they were singing. The effect was
thoroughly diverting and more than one serious
person was heard to declare that the future of
opera had been solved, although Mme. Rimsky-Korsakow,
as she had on a similar occasion when
the Russian Ballet had produced Fokine’s version
of <i>Scheherazade</i>, protested.</p>

<p>Rimsky-Korsakow wrote his opera to be sung
in the ordinary fashion, and, in so far as this matters,
it was perhaps a desecration to perform it
in any other manner. However, quite beyond the
fact that very large audiences were hugely delighted
with <i>The Golden Cock</i> in its new form,
these performances served to fire Strawinsky with
the inspiration for his new work. He intends <i>The
Village Weddings</i> to be given precisely in this
manner. It is an opera, the rôles of which are
to be sung by artists who sit still while the figures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>of the ballet will enact them. The words, I am
told, are entirely derived from Russian folk stories
and ballads, pieced together by the composer himself,
and the action is to be like that of a marionette
show in which the characters are worked
by strings from above. It may also be stated on
the same authority that the music, while embracing
new tone colours and dramatic effects, is as
tuneful as any yet set on paper by this extraordinary
young man; the songs have a true folk
flavour. The whole, it is probable, will make as
enchanting a stage entertainment as any which
this composer has yet contrived.</p>

<p>It is not only folk-tunes but popular songs as
well that fascinate Igor Strawinsky. Ernest
Ansermet collected literally hundreds of examples
of American ragtime songs and dances to take
back to the composer, and he pointed out to me
how Strawinsky had used similar specimens in the
past. For example, the barrel organ solo in the
first scene of <i>Petrouchka</i> is a popular French song
of several seasons ago, <i>La Jambe de Bois</i> (a
song now forbidden in Paris); the final wedding
music in <i>The Firebird</i> is an <i>adagio</i> version
of a popular Russian song, with indecent words.
He sees beauty in these popular tunes, too
much beauty to be allowed to go to waste. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>the same spirit he has taken the melodies of two
Lanner waltzes for the dance between the Ballerina
and the Moor in the third scene of <i>Petrouchka</i>.
It would not surprise me at all to discover <i>Hello
Frisco</i> bobbing up in one of his future works.
After all turn about is fair play; the popular composers
have dug gold mines out of the classics.</p>

<p>Consistent, certainly, is Strawinsky’s delight in
clowns and music halls—the burlesque and the
eccentric. He has written a ballet for four
clowns, and Ansermet showed me one day an arrangement
for four hands of three pieces, for small
orchestra, in <i>style music hall</i>, dated 1914. We
gave what we smilingly referred to as the “first
American audition” on the grand pianoforte in
his hotel room. I played the base, not a matter
of any particular difficulty in the first number,
a polka, because the first bar was repeated to the
end. This polka, I found very amusing and we
played it over several times. The valse, which
followed, reminded me of the Lanner number in
<i>Petrouchka</i>. The suite closed with a march, dedicated
to Alfred Casella.... The pieces would delight
any audience, from that of the Palace Theatre,
to that of the concerts of the Symphony Society
of New York.</p>

<p class="ph2">Leo Ornstein</p></div>


<p>The amazing Leo Ornstein!... I should
have written the amazing Leo Ornsteins for
“there are many of them and each one of
them is one.” Ornstein himself has a symbol for
this diversity; some of his music he signs “Vannin.”
He has told me that the signature is automatic:
when Vannin writes he signs; when Ornstein
writes <i>he</i> signs. But it is not alone in composing
that there are many Ornsteins; there are many
pianists as well. One Ornstein paints his tones
with a fine soft brush; the other smears on his
colours with a trowel. In his sentimental treatment
of triviality he has scarcely a competitor on
the serious concert stage (unless it be Fanny
Bloomfield-Zeisler). Is this the Caliban, one asks,
who conceived and who executes <i>The Wild Men’s
Dance</i>? The softer Ornstein is less original than
his comrade, more imitative.... I have been told
that Jews are always imitative in art, that there
are no great Jewish composers. Wagner? Well,
Wagner was half a Jew, perhaps. Certainly there
is imitation in Ornstein, but so was there in the
young Beethoven, the young Debussy....</p>

<p>Recently I went to hear Ornstein play under a
misconception. I thought that he, with an announced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>violinist, was going to perform his anarchistic
sonata for violin and piano, opus 31.
They did perform one of his sonatas but it was
an earlier opus, 26, I think. At times, while I
listened it seemed to me that nothing so beautiful
had been done in this form since César Franck’s
sonata. The first movement had a rhapsodic
character that was absolutely successful in establishing
a mood. The music soared; it did not
seem confined at all. It achieved perfectly the
effect of improvisation. The second part was
even finer, and the scherzo and finale only less good.
But this was no new idiom. I looked again and
again at my programme; again and again at the
man on the piano stool. Was this not Harold
Bauer playing Ravel?... One theme struck me
as astonishingly like Johnson’s air in the last act
of <i>The Girl of the Golden West</i>. There was a
good use made of the whole-tone scale and its attendant
harmonies, which sounded strangely in our
ears a few seasons past, and a ravishing series of
figurations and runs made one remember that Debussy
had described falling water in a similar
fashion.</p>

<p>This over the pianist became less himself—so
far as I had become acquainted with him to this
time—than ever. He played a banal barcarole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>of Rubinstein’s; to be sure he almost made it sound
like an interesting composition; he played a
scherzino of his own that any one from Schütt
to Moszkowski might have signed; he played something
of Grieg’s which may have pleased Mr. Finck
and two or three ladies in the audience but which
certainly left me cold; and he concluded this group
with a performance of Liszt’s arrangement of the
waltz from Gounod’s <i>Faust</i>. Thereupon there was
so much applause that he came back and played
his scherzino again. His répertoire in this <i>genre</i>
was probably too limited to admit of his adding
a fresh number.... At this point I arose and
left the hall, more in wonder than in indignation.</p>

<p>Was this the musician who had been reviled and
hissed? Was this the pianist and composer whom
Huneker had dubbed the only real futurist in modern
music? It was not the Ornstein I myself had
heard a few weeks previously striking the keyboards
with his fists in the vociferous measures of
<i>The Wild Men’s Dance</i>; it was not the colour
painter of the two <i>Impressions of Notre Dame</i>;
it was not the Ornstein who in a dark corner of
Pogliani’s glowed with glee over the possibility of
dividing and redividing the existing scale into
eighth, sixteenth, and twenty-fourth tones....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>This was another Ornstein and in searching my
memory I discovered him to be the oldest Ornstein
of all. I remembered five years back when I was
assistant to the musical critic of the “New York
Times” and had been sent to hear a boy prodigy
play on a Sunday evening at the New Amsterdam
Theatre. Concerts by serious artists at that
period seldom took place outside of recognized
concert halls, nor did they occur on Sunday nights.
But there was something about this concert that
impressed itself upon me and I wrote more than
the usual perfunctory notice on this occasion.
Here is my account of what I think must have been
Leo Ornstein’s first public appearance (March 5,
1911), dug from an old scrap book:</p>

<p>“The New Amsterdam Theatre is a strange
place for a recital of pianoforte music, but one was
held there last evening, when Leo Ornstein, the
latest wunderkind to claim metropolitan attention,
appeared before a very large audience to contribute
his interpretation of a programme which
would have tested any fully grown-up talent.</p>

<p>“It began with Bach’s Chromatic Fantasy and
Fugue, included Beethoven’s <i>Sonata Appassionata</i>,
six Chopin numbers, and finally Rubinstein’s D
minor concerto, in which young Ornstein was assisted
by the Volpe Symphony Orchestra. To say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>that this boy has great talent would be to mention
the obvious, but to say that as yet he is ripe for
such matters as he undertook last night would be
stretching the truth. It should be stated, however,
that his command of tone colour is already
great and that his technique is usually adequate
for the demands which the music made, although
in some passages in the final movement of the
Beethoven sonata his strength seemed to desert
him.”</p>

<p>I never even heard of Leo Ornstein again after
this concert at the New Amsterdam (his exploits
in Europe escaped my eyes and ears) until he gave
the famous series of concerts at the Bandbox Theatre
in January and February of 1915, a series
of concerts which really startled musical New York
and even aroused orchestral conductors, in some
measure, out of their lethargic method of programme-making.
So far as he was able Ornstein
constructed his programmes entirely from the
“music of the future,” and patrons of piano recitals
were astonished to discover that a pianist
could give four concerts without playing any music
by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms,
Liszt, or Schubert.... Since these occasions
Ornstein has been considered the high apostle of
the new art in America, as the post-futurist composer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>and as a pianist of great technical powers
and a luscious tone quality (it does not seem
strange that these attributes are somewhat exaggerated
in so young a man).</p>

<p>Nearly a year later (December 15, 1915, to be
exact) Ornstein gave another concert at the Cort
Theatre in New York. Here are my impressions
of that occasion, noted down shortly after:</p>

<p>“Leo Ornstein, a few years ago a poor Russian
Jew music student, is rapidly by way of becoming
an institution. His concerts are largely attended
and he is even taken seriously by the press, especially
in England.</p>

<p>“He slouched on the stage, stooping, in his
usual listless manner, his long arms hanging limp
at his sides like those of a gorilla. His head is
beautiful, crowned with an overflowing crop of
black hair, soulful eyes, a fine mask. There are
pauses without expression but sometimes, notably
when he plays <i>The Wild Men’s Dance</i>, his face
lights up with a sort of sardonic appreciation.
He has discarded his sack cloth coat for a velvet
jacket of similar cut.</p>

<p>“He began with two lovely impressionistic
things by Vannin (Sanborn says that this is ‘programme
for Ornstein’), <i>The Waltzers</i> and <i>Night</i>.
A long sonata by Cyril Scott (almost entirely in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>the whole-tone scale, sounding consequently like
Debussy out of Bach, for there was a fugue and
a smell of the academy) followed. Ravel’s
<i>Oiseaux Tristes</i> twittered their sorrows prettily in
the treble, and a sonatina by the same composer
seemed negligible. Albeniz’s <i>Almeria</i>, a section
of the twelve-parted <i>Iberia</i>, was a Spanish picture
of worth. Ornstein followed with his own pieces,
<i>Improvisata</i>, a vivid bit of colour and rhythm, and
<i>Impressions of the Thames</i>, in which an attempt
was made to picture the heavy smoking barges,
the labours on the river, the shrill sirens of the
tugs. The limited (is it, I wonder?) medium of
the piano made all this sound rather Chinese.
But some got the picture. A few laughed. <i>The
Wild Men’s Dance</i> convulsed certain parts of the
audience. It always does (but this may well be
hysteria); others were struck with wonder by its
thrill. Certainly a powerful massing of notes,
creating wild effects in tone, and a compelling
rhythm. In the <i>Fairy Pictures</i> of Korngold,
which closed the programme, Ornstein was not at
his best; nor, for that matter, was Korngold.
They were written when the composer was a very
young boy and they are not particularly original,
spontaneous, or beautiful. The difficulties exist
for the player rather than for the hearer....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>Ornstein did not bring out their humour. Humour,
as yet, is not an attribute of his playing.
He has always imparted to the piano a beautiful
tone; his touch is almost as fine as Pachmann’s.
But his powers are ripening in every direction.
Formerly he dwelt too long on nuances, fussed too
much with details. His style is becoming broader.
His technique has always been ample. There is
no doubt but that he will become a power in the
music world.”</p>

<p>Some time later I met Leo Ornstein and we
talked over a table. He is fluid in conversation
and while he talks he clasps and unclasps his hands....
He referred to his début at the New Amsterdam.
“My ambition then was to play the concertos
of Rubinstein and Tschaikowsky ... and
I satisfied it. Soon after that concert I went
abroad.... Suddenly the new thing came to me,
and I began to write and play in the style which
has since become identified with my name. It was
music that I felt and I realized that I had become
myself at last, although at first, to be frank, it
horrified me as much as it has since horrified others.
Mind you, when I took the leap I had never
seen any music by Schoenberg or Strawinsky. I
was unaware that there was such a generality as
‘futurism.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>
<p>“I spent some time in Norway and Vienna,
where I met Leschetitzky” (this incident is referred
to elsewhere in this volume) “and then I
went down to Paris. I was very poor.... I
met Harold Bauer and one day I went to play for
him. We had a furious argument all day. He
couldn’t understand my music. But he asked me
to come again the next day, and I did. This
time Walter Morse Rummel was there and he suggested
that Calvocoressi would be interested in me.
So he gave me a note to Calvocoressi.</p>

<p>“Calvocoressi is a Greek but he speaks all
languages. He read my note of introduction and
asked me if I spoke French or English. We spoke
a little Russian together. Then he asked me to
play. While I played his eyes snapped and he
uttered several sudden ejaculations. ‘Play that
again,’ he said, when I had concluded one piece.
Later on he asked some of his friends to hear me....
At the time he was giving a series of lectures
on modern musicians, Strauss, Debussy, Dukas,
Ravel, Schoenberg, and Strawinsky, and he included
<i>me</i> in the list! I illustrated two of his lectures
and after I had concluded my performance
of the music of other composers he asked me to
play something of my own, which I did....”
Ornstein looked amusingly rueful. “The auditors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>were not actually rude. How could they be
when I followed Calvocoressi? But they giggled
a little. Later on in London they did more than
giggle.</p>

<p>“I went to London because my means were getting
low. I had almost no money at all, as a matter
of fact.... In London I found Calvocoressi’s
influence of great value (he had already written
an article about me) and some people at Oxford
had heard me in Paris. These friends helped; besides
I played the Steinway piano and the Steinways
finally gave me a concert in Steinway Hall.
At my first concert (this was in the spring of
1914) I played music by other composers. At
my second concert, devoted to my own compositions,
I might have played anything. I couldn’t
hear the piano myself. The crowd whistled and
howled and even threw handy missiles on the stage
... but that concert made me famous,” Ornstein
wound up with a smile.</p>

<p>He is a hard-working youth, serious, it would
seem, to the heart. His published music is numbered
into the thirties and his répertoire is extensive.
He spends a great deal of time working
hard on the music of a bygone age, although he
finds it no stimulation for this one, but to be taken
seriously as a pianist he is obliged to prove to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>melomaniacs that he has the equipment to play
the classic composers. Of all the compositions
that he learns, however, he complains of his own
as the most difficult to memorize; a glance at <i>The
Wild Men’s Dance</i> or more particularly at a page
of his second sonata for violin and piano will convince
any one of the truth of this assertion. The
chords will prove strangers to many a well-trained
eye. I wonder if so uncannily gifted a sight
reader as Walter Damrosch, who can play an
orchestral score on the piano at sight, could read
this music?</p>

<p>Of his principles of composition the boy says
only that he writes what he feels. He has no regard
for the rules, although he has studied them
enough to break them thoroughly. He thinks
there is an underlying basis of theory for his
method of composition, which may be formulated
later. It is not his purpose to formulate it. He
is sincere in his art.</p>

<p>Once he said to me, “I hate cleverness. I don’t
want to be clever. I hate to be called clever. I
am not clever. I don’t like clever people. Art
that is merely clever is not art at all.”</p>

<p>With Busoni and Schoenberg he believes that
there are no discords, only chords and chords ...
and that there are many combinations of notes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>“millions of them” which have not yet been devised.</p>

<p>“When I feel that the existing enharmonic
scale is limiting me I shall write in quarter
tones. In time I think the ear can be trained to
grasp eighth tones. Instruments only exist to
perform music and new instruments will be created
to meet the new need. It can be met now on the
violin or in the voice. The piano, of course, is
responsible for the rigidity of the present scale.”</p>

<p>Ornstein never rewrites. If his inspiration does
not come the first time it never comes. He does
not try to improve a failure. His method is to
write as much as he can spontaneously on one day,
and to pick the composition up where he left off
on the next.</p>

<p>His opinions of other modern composers are
interesting: he considers Ravel greater than Debussy,
and speaks with enthusiasm about <i>Daphnis
et Chloë</i>. He has played music by Satie in private
but does not find it “stimulating or interesting.” ...
Schoenberg ... “the last of the academics
... all brain, no spirit. His music is
mathematical. He does not feel it. Korngold’s
pieces are pretty but he has done nothing important.
Scriabine was a great theorist who
never achieved his goal. He helped others on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>But Strawinsky is the most stimulating and interesting
of all the modern composers. He feels what
he writes.”</p>

<p>Most of Ornstein’s music is inspired by things
about him, some of it by abstract ideas. His
social conscience is awake. He wanted to call
<i>The Wild Men’s Dance</i>, <i>Liberty</i> (“I attempted to
write music which would dance itself, which did
not require a dancer”), but finally decided on the
more symbolic title. “I am known as a musical
anarch now,” he explained to me, “I could not
name a piece of music <i>Liberty</i>—at least not <i>that</i>
piece—without associating myself in the public
mind with a certain social propaganda.” Just
the same he means the propaganda. In the <i>Dwarf
Suite</i> he gives us a picture of the lives of the
struggling Russian Jews. These dwarfs are symbols....
He is fond of abstract titles. He often
plays his <i>Three Moods</i>. “In Boston they did not
like my <i>Three Moods</i>. They found my <i>Anger</i> too
unrestrained; it was vulgar to express oneself so
freely.... But there is such a thing as anger.
Why should it not find artistic expression? Besides
it is a very good contrast to <i>Peace</i> and <i>Joy</i>
which enclose it.” The <i>Impressions of the Thames</i>
I have already referred to. With the two <i>Impressions
of Notre Dame</i> it stands as his successful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>experiment with impressionism. The <i>Notre Dame</i>
pictures include gargoyles and, of course, bells....
I have not heard the violin and piano sonata,
opus 31. Nor can I play it. Nor can I derive
any very adequate idea of how it sounds from a perusal
of the score. Strange music this.... Some
time ago some one sent Ornstein the eight songs of
Richard Strauss, Opus 49. The words of three
of these songs (<i>Wiegenliedchen</i>, <i>In Goldener Fülle</i>,
and <i>Waldseligkeit</i>) struck him and he made settings
for them. Compare them with Strauss and
you will find the Bavarian’s music scented with
lavender. “In the <i>Wiegenliedchen</i> Strauss gives
you a picture of the woman rocking the cradle for
his accompaniment. I have tried to go further,
tried to express the feelings in the woman’s mind,
her hopes for the child when it is grown, her fears.
I have tried to get <i>underneath</i>.” But the
<i>Berceuse</i> in Ornstein’s <i>Nine Miniatures</i> is as simple
an expression as the lover of Ethelbert Nevin’s
style could wish. Not all of Ornstein’s music is
careless of tradition. He was influenced in the
beginning by many people. His <i>Russian Suite</i> is
very pretty. Most of it is like Tschaikowsky.
These suites will prove (if any one wants it
proved) that Ornstein can write conventional
melody.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>
<p>Ornstein has also written a composition for
orchestra entitled <i>The Faun</i>, which Henry Wood
had in mind for performance before the war. It
has not yet been played and I humbly suggest it
to our resident conductors, together with Albeniz’s
<i>Catalonia</i>, Schoenberg’s <i>Five Pieces</i>, and Strawinsky’s
<i>Sacrifice to the Spring</i>.</p>

<p>Leo Ornstein was born in 1895 at Krementchug,
near Odessa. He is consequently in his twenty-first
year. He is already a remarkable pianist,
one of the very few who may be expected to achieve
a position in the front rank. His compositions
have astonished the musical world. Some of them
have even pleased people. Whatever their ultimate
value they have certainly made it a deal
easier for concert-goers to listen to what are called
“discords” with equanimity. His music is a
modern expression, untraditional, and full of a
strange seething emotion; no calculation here.
And like the best painting and literature of the
epoch it vibrates with the unrest of the period
which produced the great war.</p>
